<h1>A DARK NIGHT&rsquo;S WORK<br />
by Elizabeth Gaskell</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p>In the county town of a certain shire there lived (about forty years
ago) one Mr. Wilkins, a conveyancing attorney of considerable standing.</p>
<p>The certain shire was but a small county, and the principal town
in it contained only about four thousand inhabitants; so in saying that
Mr. Wilkins was the principal lawyer in Hamley, I say very little, unless
I add that he transacted all the legal business of the gentry for twenty
miles round.&nbsp; His grandfather had established the connection; his
father had consolidated and strengthened it, and, indeed, by his wise
and upright conduct, as well as by his professional skill, had obtained
for himself the position of confidential friend to many of the surrounding
families of distinction.&nbsp; He visited among them in a way which
no mere lawyer had ever done before; dined at their tables&mdash;he
alone, not accompanied by his wife, be it observed; rode to the meet
occasionally as if by accident, although he was as well mounted as any
squire among them, and was often persuaded (after a little coquetting
about &ldquo;professional engagements,&rdquo; and &ldquo;being wanted
at the office&rdquo;) to have a run with his clients; nay, once or twice
he forgot his usual caution, was first in at the death, and rode home
with the brush.&nbsp; But in general he knew his place; as his place
was held to be in that aristocratic county, and in those days.&nbsp;
Nor let be supposed that he was in any way a toadeater.&nbsp; He respected
himself too much for that.&nbsp; He would give the most unpalatable
advice, if need were; would counsel an unsparing reduction of expenditure
to an extravagant man; would recommend such an abatement of family pride
as paved the way for one or two happy marriages in some instances; nay,
what was the most likely piece of conduct of all to give offence forty
years ago, he would speak up for an unjustly-used tenant; and that with
so much temperate and well-timed wisdom and good feeling, that he more
than once gained his point.&nbsp; He had one son, Edward.&nbsp; This
boy was the secret joy and pride of his father&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp;
For himself he was not in the least ambitious, but it did cost him a
hard struggle to acknowledge that his own business was too lucrative,
and brought in too large an income, to pass away into the hands of a
stranger, as it would do if he indulged his ambition for his son by
giving him a college education and making him into a barrister.&nbsp;
This determination on the more prudent side of the argument took place
while Edward was at Eton.&nbsp; The lad had, perhaps, the largest allowance
of pocket-money of any boy at school; and he had always looked forward
to going to Christ Church along with his fellows, the sons of the squires,
his father&rsquo;s employers.&nbsp; It was a severe mortification to
him to find that his destiny was changed, and that he had to return
to Hamley to be articled to his father, and to assume the hereditary
subservient position to lads whom he had licked in the play-ground,
and beaten at learning.</p>
<p>His father tried to compensate him for the disappointment by every
indulgence which money could purchase.&nbsp; Edward&rsquo;s horses were
even finer than those of his father; his literary tastes were kept up
and fostered, by his father&rsquo;s permission to form an extensive
library, for which purpose a noble room was added to Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s
already extensive house in the suburbs of Hamley.&nbsp; And after his
year of legal study in London his father sent him to make the grand
tour, with something very like carte blanche as to expenditure, to judge
from the packages which were sent home from various parts of the Continent.</p>
<p>At last he came home&mdash;came back to settle as his father&rsquo;s
partner at Hamley.&nbsp; He was a son to be proud of, and right down
proud was old Mr. Wilkins of his handsome, accomplished, gentlemanly
lad.&nbsp; For Edward was not one to be spoilt by the course of indulgence
he had passed through; at least, if it had done him an injury, the effects
were at present hidden from view.&nbsp; He had no vulgar vices; he was,
indeed, rather too refined for the society he was likely to be thrown
into, even supposing that society to consist of the highest of his father&rsquo;s
employers.&nbsp; He was well read, and an artist of no mean pretensions.&nbsp;
Above all, &ldquo;his heart was in the right place,&rdquo; as his father
used to observe.&nbsp; Nothing could exceed the deference he always
showed to him.&nbsp; His mother had long been dead.</p>
<p>I do not know whether it was Edward&rsquo;s own ambition or his proud
father&rsquo;s wishes that had led him to attend the Hamley assemblies.&nbsp;
I should conjecture the latter, for Edward had of himself too much good
taste to wish to intrude into any society.&nbsp; In the opinion of all
the shire, no society had more reason to consider itself select than
that which met at every full moon in the Hamley assembly-room, an excrescence
built on to the principal inn in the town by the joint subscription
of all the county families.&nbsp; Into those choice and mysterious precincts
no towns person was ever allowed to enter; no professional man might
set his foot therein; no infantry officer saw the interior of that ball,
or that card-room.&nbsp; The old original subscribers would fain have
had a man prove his sixteen quarterings before he might make his bow
to the queen of the night; but the old original founders of the Hamley
assemblies were dropping off; minuets had vanished with them, country
dances had died away; quadrilles were in high vogue&mdash;nay, one or
two of the high magnates of ---shire were trying to introduce waltzing,
as they had seen it in London, where it had come in with the visit of
the allied sovereigns, when Edward Wilkins made his <i>d&eacute;but</i>
on these boards.&nbsp; He had been at many splendid assemblies abroad,
but still the little old ballroom attached to the George Inn in his
native town was to him a place grander and more awful than the most
magnificent saloons he had seen in Paris or Rome.&nbsp; He laughed at
himself for this unreasonable feeling of awe; but there it was notwithstanding.&nbsp;
He had been dining at the house of one of the lesser gentry, who was
under considerable obligations to his father, and who was the parent
of eight &ldquo;muckle-mou&rsquo;ed&rdquo; daughters, so hardly likely
to oppose much aristocratic resistance to the elder Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s
clearly implied wish that Edward should be presented at the Hamley assembly-rooms.&nbsp;
But many a squire glowered and looked black at the introduction of Wilkins
the attorney&rsquo;s son into the sacred precincts; and perhaps there
would have been much more mortification than pleasure in this assembly
to the young man, had it not been for an incident that occurred pretty
late in the evening.&nbsp; The lord-lieutenant of the county usually
came with a large party to the Hamley assemblies once in a season; and
this night he was expected, and with him a fashionable duchess and her
daughters.&nbsp; But time wore on, and they did not make their appearance.&nbsp;
At last there was a rustling and a bustling, and in sailed the superb
party.&nbsp; For a few minutes dancing was stopped; the earl led the
duchess to a sofa; some of their acquaintances came up to speak to them;
and then the quadrilles were finished in rather a flat manner.&nbsp;
A country dance followed, in which none of the lord-lieutenant&rsquo;s
party joined; then there was a consultation, a request, an inspection
of the dancers, a message to the orchestra, and the band struck up a
waltz; the duchess&rsquo;s daughters flew off to the music, and some
more young ladies seemed ready to follow, but, alas! there was a lack
of gentlemen acquainted with the new-fashioned dance.&nbsp; One of the
stewards bethought him of young Wilkins, only just returned from the
Continent.&nbsp; Edward was a beautiful dancer, and waltzed to admiration.&nbsp;
For his next partner he had one of the Lady ---s; for the duchess, to
whom the&mdash;shire squires and their little county politics and contempts
were alike unknown, saw no reason why her lovely Lady Sophy should not
have a good partner, whatever his pedigree might be, and begged the
stewards to introduce Mr. Wilkins to her.&nbsp; After this night his
fortune was made with the young ladies of the Hamley assemblies.&nbsp;
He was not unpopular with the mammas; but the heavy squires still looked
at him askance, and the heirs (whom he had licked at Eton) called him
an upstart behind his back.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p>It was not a satisfactory situation.&nbsp; Mr. Wilkins had given
his son an education and tastes beyond his position.&nbsp; He could
not associate with either profit or pleasure with the doctor or the
brewer of Hamley; the vicar was old and deaf, the curate a raw young
man, half frightened at the sound of his own voice.&nbsp; Then, as to
matrimony&mdash;for the idea of his marriage was hardly more present
in Edward&rsquo;s mind than in that of his father&mdash;he could scarcely
fancy bringing home any one of the young ladies of Hamley to the elegant
mansion, so full of suggestion and association to an educated person,
so inappropriate a dwelling for an ignorant, uncouth, ill-brought-up
girl.&nbsp; Yet Edward was fully aware, if his fond father was not,
that of all the young ladies who were glad enough of him as a partner
at the Hamley assemblies, there was not of them but would have considered
herself affronted by an offer of marriage from an attorney, the son
and grandson of attorneys.&nbsp; The young man had perhaps received
many a slight and mortification pretty quietly during these years, which
yet told upon his character in after life.&nbsp; Even at this very time
they were having their effect.&nbsp; He was of too sweet a disposition
to show resentment, as many men would have done.&nbsp; But nevertheless
he took a secret pleasure in the power which his father&rsquo;s money
gave him.&nbsp; He would buy an expensive horse after five minutes&rsquo;
conversation as to the price, about which a needy heir of one of the
proud county families had been haggling for three weeks.&nbsp; His dogs
were from the best kennels in England, no matter at what cost; his guns
were the newest and most improved make; and all these were expenses
on objects which were among those of daily envy to the squires and squires&rsquo;
sons around.&nbsp; They did not much care for the treasures of art,
which report said were being accumulated in Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;
But they did covet the horses and hounds he possessed, and the young
man knew that they coveted, and rejoiced in it.</p>
<p>By-and-by he formed a marriage, which went as near as marriages ever
do towards pleasing everybody.&nbsp; He was desperately in love with
Miss Lamotte, so he was delighted when she consented to be his wife.&nbsp;
His father was delighted in his delight, and, besides, was charmed to
remember that Miss Lamotte&rsquo;s mother had been Sir Frank Holster&rsquo;s
younger sister, and that, although her marriage had been disowned by
her family, as beneath her in rank, yet no one could efface her name
out of the Baronetage, where Lettice, youngest daughter of Sir Mark
Holster, born 1772, married H. Lamotte, 1799, died 1810, was duly chronicled.&nbsp;
She had left two children, a boy and a girl, of whom their uncle, Sir
Frank, took charge, as their father was worse than dead&mdash;an outlaw
whose name was never mentioned.&nbsp; Mark Lamotte was in the army;
Lettice had a dependent position in her uncle&rsquo;s family; not intentionally
made more dependent than was rendered necessary by circumstances, but
still dependent enough to grate on the feelings of a sensitive girl,
whose natural susceptibilty to slights was redoubled by the constant
recollection of her father&rsquo;s disgrace.&nbsp; As Mr. Wilkins well
knew, Sir Frank was considerably involved; but it was with very mixed
feelings that he listened to the suit which would provide his penniless
niece with a comfortable, not to say luxurious, home, and with a handsome,
accomplished young man of unblemished character for a husband.&nbsp;
He said one or two bitter and insolent things to Mr. Wilkins, even while
he was giving his consent to the match; that was his temper, his proud,
evil temper; but he really and permanently was satisfied with the connection,
though he would occasionally turn round on his nephew-in-law, and sting
him with a covert insult, as to his want of birth, and the inferior
position which he held, forgetting, apparently, that his own brother-in-law
and Lettice&rsquo;s father might be at any moment brought to the bar
of justice if he attempted to re-enter his native country.</p>
<p>Edward was annoyed at all this; Lettice resented it.&nbsp; She loved
her husband dearly, and was proud of him, for she had discernment enough
to see how superior he was in every way to her cousins, the young Holsters,
who borrowed his horses, drank his wines, and yet had caught their father&rsquo;s
habit of sneering at his profession.&nbsp; Lettice wished that Edward
would content himself with a purely domestic life, would let himself
drop out of the company of the ---shire squirearchy, and find his relaxation
with her, in their luxurious library, or lovely drawing-room, so full
of white gleaming statues, and gems of pictures.&nbsp; But, perhaps,
this was too much to expect of any man, especially of one who felt himself
fitted in many ways to shine in society, and who was social by nature.&nbsp;
Sociality in that county at that time meant conviviality.&nbsp; Edward
did not care for wine, and yet he was obliged to drink&mdash;and by-and-by
he grew to pique himself on his character as a judge of wine.&nbsp;
His father by this time was dead; dead, happy old man, with a contented
heart&mdash;his affairs flourishing, his poorer neighbours loving him,
his richer respecting him, his son and daughter-in-law, the most affectionate
and devoted that ever man had, and his healthy conscience at peace with
his God.</p>
<p>Lettice could have lived to herself and her husband and children.&nbsp;
Edward daily required more and more the stimulus of society.&nbsp; His
wife wondered how he could care to accept dinner invitations from people
who treated him as &ldquo;Wilkins the attorney, a very good sort of
fellow,&rdquo; as they introduced him to strangers who might be staying
in the country, but who had no power to appreciate the taste, the talents,
the impulsive artistic nature which she held so dear.&nbsp; She forgot
that by accepting such invitations Edward was occasionally brought into
contact with people not merely of high conventional, but of high intellectual
rank; that when a certain amount of wine had dissipated his sense of
inferiority of rank and position, he was a brilliant talker, a man to
be listened to and admired even by wandering London statesmen, professional
diners-out, or any great authors who might find themselves visitors
in a ---shire country-house.&nbsp; What she would have had him share
from the pride of her heart, she should have warned him to avoid from
the temptations to sinful extravagance which it led him into.&nbsp;
He had begun to spend more than he ought, not in intellectual&mdash;though
that would have been wrong&mdash;but in purely sensual things.&nbsp;
His wines, his table, should be such as no squire&rsquo;s purse or palate
could command.&nbsp; His dinner-parties&mdash;small in number, the viands
rare and delicate in quality, and sent up to table by an Italian cook&mdash;should
be such as even the London stars should notice with admiration.&nbsp;
He would have Lettice dressed in the richest materials, the most delicate
lace; jewellery, he said, was beyond their means; glancing with proud
humility at the diamonds of the elder ladies, and the alloyed gold of
the younger.&nbsp; But he managed to spend as much on his wife&rsquo;s
lace as would have bought many a set of inferior jewellery.&nbsp; Lettice
well became it all.&nbsp; If as people said, her father had been nothing
but a French adventurer, she bore traces of her nature in her grace,
her delicacy, her fascinating and elegant ways of doing all things.&nbsp;
She was made for society; and yet she hated it.&nbsp; And one day she
went out of it altogether and for evermore.&nbsp; She had been well
in the morning when Edward went down to his office in Hamley.&nbsp;
At noon he was sent for by hurried trembling messengers.&nbsp; When
he got home breathless and uncomprehending, she was past speech.&nbsp;
One glance from her lovely loving black eyes showed that she recognised
him with the passionate yearning that had been one of the characteristics
of her love through life.&nbsp; There was no word passed between them.&nbsp;
He could not speak, any more than could she.&nbsp; He knelt down by
her.&nbsp; She was dying; she was dead; and he knelt on immovable.&nbsp;
They brought him his eldest child, Ellinor, in utter despair what to
do in order to rouse him.&nbsp; They had no thought as to the effect
on her, hitherto shut up in the nursery during this busy day of confusion
and alarm.&nbsp; The child had no idea of death, and her father, kneeling
and tearless, was far less an object of surprise or interest to her
than her mother, lying still and white, and not turning her head to
smile at her darling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma! mamma!&rdquo; cried the child, in shapeless terror.&nbsp;
But the mother never stirred; and the father hid his face yet deeper
in the bedclothes, to stifle a cry as if a sharp knife had pierced his
heart.&nbsp; The child forced her impetuous way from her attendants,
and rushed to the bed.&nbsp; Undeterred by deadly cold or stony immobility,
she kissed the lips and stroked the glossy raven hair, murmuring sweet
words of wild love, such as had passed between the mother and child
often and often when no witnesses were by; and altogether seemed so
nearly beside herself in an agony of love and terror, that Edward arose,
and softly taking her in his arms, bore her away, lying back like one
dead (so exhausted was she by the terrible emotion they had forced on
her childish heart), into his study, a little room opening out of the
grand library, where on happy evenings, never to come again, he and
his wife were wont to retire to have coffee together, and then perhaps
stroll out of the glass-door into the open air, the shrubbery, the fields&mdash;never
more to be trodden by those dear feet.&nbsp; What passed between father
and child in this seclusion none could tell.&nbsp; Late in the evening
Ellinor&rsquo;s supper was sent for, and the servant who brought it
in saw the child lying as one dead in her father&rsquo;s arms, and before
he left the room watched his master feeding her, the girl of six years
of age, with as tender care as if she had been a baby of six months.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p>From that time the tie between father and daughter grew very strong
and tender indeed.&nbsp; Ellinor, it is true, divided her affection
between her baby sister and her papa; but he, caring little for babies,
had only a theoretic regard for his younger child, while the elder absorbed
all his love.&nbsp; Every day that he dined at home Ellinor was placed
opposite to him while he ate his late dinner; she sat where her mother
had done during the meal, although she had dined and even supped some
time before on the more primitive nursery fare.&nbsp; It was half pitiful,
half amusing, to see the little girl&rsquo;s grave, thoughtful ways
and modes of speech, as if trying to act up to the dignity of her place
as her father&rsquo;s companion, till sometimes the little head nodded
off to slumber in the middle of lisping some wise little speech.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Old-fashioned,&rdquo; the nurses called her, and prophesied that
she would not live long in consequence of her old-fashionedness.&nbsp;
But instead of the fulfilment of this prophecy, the fat bright baby
was seized with fits, and was well, ill, and dead in a day!&nbsp; Ellinor&rsquo;s
grief was something alarming, from its quietness and concealment.&nbsp;
She waited till she was left&mdash;as she thought&mdash;alone at nights,
and then sobbed and cried her passionate cry for &ldquo;Baby, baby,
come back to me&mdash;come back;&rdquo; till every one feared for the
health of the frail little girl whose childish affections had had to
stand two such shocks.&nbsp; Her father put aside all business, all
pleasure of every kind, to win his darling from her grief.&nbsp; No
mother could have done more, no tenderest nurse done half so much as
Mr. Wilkins then did for Ellinor.</p>
<p>If it had not been for him she would have just died of her grief.&nbsp;
As it was, she overcame it&mdash;but slowly, wearily&mdash;hardly letting
herself love anyone for some time, as if she instinctively feared lest
all her strong attachments should find a sudden end in death.&nbsp;
Her love&mdash;thus dammed up into a small space&mdash;at last burst
its banks, and overflowed on her father.&nbsp; It was a rich reward
to him for all his care of her, and he took delight&mdash;perhaps a
selfish delight&mdash;in all the many pretty ways she perpetually found
of convincing him, if he had needed conviction, that he was ever the
first object with her.&nbsp; The nurse told him that half an hour or
so before the earliest time at which he could be expected home in the
evenings, Miss Ellinor began to fold up her doll&rsquo;s things and
lull the inanimate treasure to sleep.&nbsp; Then she would sit and listen
with an intensity of attention for his footstep.&nbsp; Once the nurse
had expressed some wonder at the distance at which Ellinor could hear
her father&rsquo;s approach, saying that she had listened and could
not hear a sound, to which Ellinor had replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you cannot; he is not your papa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, when he went away in the morning, after he had kissed her,
Ellinor would run to a certain window from which she could watch him
up the lane, now hidden behind a hedge, now reappearing through an open
space, again out of sight, till he reached a great old beech-tree, where
for an instant more she saw him.&nbsp; And then she would turn away
with a sigh, sometimes reassuring her unspoken fears by saying softly
to herself,</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will come again to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wilkins liked to feel his child dependent on him for all her
pleasures.&nbsp; He was even a little jealous of anyone who devised
a treat or conferred a present, the first news of which did not come
from or through him.</p>
<p>At last it was necessary that Ellinor should have some more instruction
than her good old nurse could give.&nbsp; Her father did not care to
take upon himself the office of teacher, which he thought he foresaw
would necessitate occasional blame, an occasional exercise of authority,
which might possibly render him less idolized by his little girl; so
he commissioned Lady Holster to choose out one among her many <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;es</i>
for a governess to his daughter.&nbsp; Now, Lady Holster, who kept a
sort of amateur county register-office, was only too glad to be made
of use in this way; but when she inquired a little further as to the
sort of person required, all she could extract from Mr. Wilkins was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the kind of education a lady should have, and will,
I am sure, choose a governess for Ellinor better than I could direct
you.&nbsp; Only, please, choose some one who will not marry me, and
who will let Ellinor go on making my tea, and doing pretty much what
she likes, for she is so good they need not try to make her better,
only to teach her what a lady should know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Monro was selected&mdash;a plain, intelligent, quiet woman of
forty&mdash;and it was difficult to decide whether she or Mr. Wilkins
took the most pains to avoid each other, acting with regard to Ellinor,
pretty much like the famous Adam and Eve in the weather-glass: when
the one came out the other went in.&nbsp; Miss Monro had been tossed
about and overworked quite enough in her life not to value the privilege
and indulgence of her evenings to herself, her comfortable schoolroom,
her quiet cozy teas, her book, or her letter-writing afterwards.&nbsp;
By mutual agreement she did not interfere with Ellinor and her ways
and occupations on the evenings when the girl had not her father for
companion; and these occasions became more and more frequent as years
passed on, and the deep shadow was lightened which the sudden death
that had visited his household had cast over him.&nbsp; As I have said
before, he was always a popular man at dinner-parties.&nbsp; His amount
of intelligence and accomplishment was rare in ---shire, and if it required
more wine than formerly to bring his conversation up to the desired
point of range and brilliancy, wine was not an article spared or grudged
at the county dinner-tables.&nbsp; Occasionally his business took him
up to London.&nbsp; Hurried as these journeys might be, he never returned
without a new game, a new toy of some kind, to &ldquo;make home pleasant
to his little maid,&rdquo; as he expressed himself.</p>
<p>He liked, too, to see what was doing in art, or in literature; and
as he gave pretty extensive orders for anything he admired, he was almost
sure to be followed down to Hamley by one or two packages or parcels,
the arrival and opening of which began soon to form the pleasant epochs
in Ellinor&rsquo;s grave though happy life.</p>
<p>The only person of his own standing with whom Mr. Wilkins kept up
any intercourse in Hamley was the new clergyman, a bachelor, about his
own age, a learned man, a fellow of his college, whose first claim on
Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s attention was the fact that he had been travelling-bachelor
for his university, and had consequently been on the Continent about
the very same two years that Mr. Wilkins had been there; and although
they had never met, yet they had many common acquaintances and common
recollections to talk over of this period, which, after all, had been
about the most bright and hopeful of Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Mr. Ness had an occasional pupil; that is to say, he never put himself
out of the way to obtain pupils, but did not refuse the entreaties sometimes
made to him that he would prepare a young man for college, by allowing
the said young man to reside and read with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ness&rsquo;s
men&rdquo; took rather high honours, for the tutor, too indolent to
find out work for himself, had a certain pride in doing well the work
that was found for him.</p>
<p>When Ellinor was somewhere about fourteen, a young Mr. Corbet came
to be pupil to Mr. Ness.&nbsp; Her father always called on the young
men reading with the clergyman, and asked them to his house.&nbsp; His
hospitality had in course of time lost its <i>recherch&eacute;</i> and
elegant character, but was always generous, and often profuse.&nbsp;
Besides, it was in his character to like the joyous, thoughtless company
of the young better than that of the old&mdash;given the same amount
of refinement and education in both.</p>
<p>Mr. Corbet was a young man of very good family, from a distant county.&nbsp;
If his character had not been so grave and deliberate, his years would
only have entitled him to be called a boy, for he was but eighteen at
the time when he came to read with Mr. Ness.&nbsp; But many men of five-and-twenty
have not reflected so deeply as this young Mr. Corbet already had.&nbsp;
He had considered and almost matured his plan for life; had ascertained
what objects he desired most to accomplish in the dim future, which
is to many at his age only a shapeless mist; and had resolved on certain
steady courses of action by which such objects were most likely to be
secured.&nbsp; A younger son, his family connections and family interest
pre-arranged a legal career for him; and it was in accordance with his
own tastes and talents.&nbsp; All, however, which his father hoped for
him was, that he might be able to make an income sufficient for a gentleman
to live on.&nbsp; Old Mr. Corbet was hardly to be called ambitious,
or, if he were, his ambition was limited to views for the eldest son.&nbsp;
But Ralph intended to be a distinguished lawyer, not so much for the
vision of the woolsack, which I suppose dances before the imagination
of every young lawyer, as for the grand intellectual exercise, and consequent
power over mankind, that distinguished lawyers may always possess if
they choose.&nbsp; A seat in Parliament, statesmanship, and all the
great scope for a powerful and active mind that lay on each side of
such a career&mdash;these were the objects which Ralph Corbet set before
himself.&nbsp; To take high honours at college was the first step to
be accomplished; and in order to achieve this Ralph had, not persuaded&mdash;persuasion
was a weak instrument which he despised&mdash;but gravely reasoned his
father into consenting to pay the large sum which Mr. Ness expected
with a pupil.&nbsp; The good-natured old squire was rather pressed for
ready money, but sooner than listen to an argument instead of taking
his nap after dinner he would have yielded anything.&nbsp; But this
did not satisfy Ralph; his father&rsquo;s reason must be convinced of
the desirability of the step, as well as his weak will give way.&nbsp;
The squire listened, looked wise, sighed; spoke of Edward&rsquo;s extravagance
and the girls&rsquo; expenses, grew sleepy, and said, &ldquo;Very true,&rdquo;
&ldquo;That is but reasonable, certainly,&rdquo; glanced at the door,
and wondered when his son would have ended his talking and go into the
drawing-room; and at length found himself writing the desired letter
to Mr. Ness, consenting to everything, terms and all.&nbsp; Mr. Ness
never had a more satisfactory pupil; one whom he could treat more as
an intellectual equal.</p>
<p>Mr. Corbet, as Ralph was always called in Hamley, was resolute in
his cultivation of himself, even exceeding what his tutor demanded of
him.&nbsp; He was greedy of information in the hours not devoted to
absolute study.&nbsp; Mr. Ness enjoyed giving information, but most
of all he liked the hard tough arguments on all metaphysical and ethical
questions in which Mr. Corbet delighted to engage him.&nbsp; They lived
together on terms of happy equality, having thus much in common.&nbsp;
They were essentially different, however, although there were so many
points of resemblance.&nbsp; Mr. Ness was unworldly as far as the idea
of real unworldliness is compatible with a turn for self-indulgence
and indolence; while Mr. Corbet was deeply, radically worldly, yet for
the accomplishment of his object could deny himself all the careless
pleasures natural to his age.&nbsp; The tutor and pupil allowed themselves
one frequent relaxation, that of Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s company.&nbsp;
Mr. Ness would stroll to the office after the six hours&rsquo; hard
reading were over&mdash;leaving Mr. Corbet still bent over the table,
book bestrewn&mdash;and see what Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s engagements were.&nbsp;
If he had nothing better to do that evening, he was either asked to
dine at the parsonage, or he, in his careless hospitable way, invited
the other two to dine with him, Ellinor forming the fourth at table,
as far as seats went, although her dinner had been eaten early with
Miss Monro.&nbsp; She was little and slight of her age, and her father
never seemed to understand how she was passing out of childhood.&nbsp;
Yet while in stature she was like a child; in intellect, in force of
character, in strength of clinging affection, she was a woman.&nbsp;
There might be much of the simplicity of a child about her, there was
little of the undeveloped girl, varying from day to day like an April
sky, careless as to which way her own character is tending.&nbsp; So
the two young people sat with their elders, and both relished the company
they were thus prematurely thrown into.&nbsp; Mr. Corbet talked as much
as either of the other two gentlemen; opposing and disputing on any
side, as if to find out how much he could urge against received opinions.&nbsp;
Ellinor sat silent; her dark eyes flashing from time to time in vehement
interest&mdash;sometimes in vehement indignation if Mr. Corbet, riding
a-tilt at everyone, ventured to attack her father.&nbsp; He saw how
this course excited her, and rather liked pursuing it in consequence;
he thought it only amused him.</p>
<p>Another way in which Ellinor and Mr. Corbet were thrown together
occasionally was this: Mr. Ness and Mr. Wilkins shared the same <i>Times</i>
between them; and it was Ellinor&rsquo;s duty to see that the paper
was regularly taken from her father&rsquo;s house to the parsonage.&nbsp;
Her father liked to dawdle over it.&nbsp; Until Mr. Corbet had come
to live with him, Mr. Ness had not much cared at what time it was passed
on to him; but the young man took a strong interest in all public events,
and especially in all that was said about them.&nbsp; He grew impatient
if the paper was not forthcoming, and would set off himself to go for
it, sometimes meeting the penitent breathless Ellinor in the long lane
which led from Hamley to Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; At first he
used to receive her eager &ldquo;Oh! I am so sorry, Mr. Corbet, but
papa has only just done with it,&rdquo; rather gruffly.&nbsp; After
a time he had the grace to tell her it did not signify; and by-and-by
he would turn back with her to give her some advice about her garden,
or her plants&mdash;for his mother and sisters were first-rate practical
gardeners, and he himself was, as he expressed it, &ldquo;a capital
consulting physician for a sickly plant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this time his voice, his step, never raised the child&rsquo;s
colour one shade the higher, never made her heart beat the least quicker,
as the slightest sign of her father&rsquo;s approach was wont to do.&nbsp;
She learnt to rely on Mr. Corbet for advice, for a little occasional
sympathy, and for much condescending attention.&nbsp; He also gave her
more fault-finding than all the rest of the world put together; and,
curiously enough, she was grateful to him for it, for she really was
humble and wished to improve.&nbsp; He liked the attitude of superiority
which this implied and exercised right gave him.&nbsp; They were very
good friends at present.&nbsp; Nothing more.</p>
<p>All this time I have spoken only of Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s life as he
stood in relation to his daughter.&nbsp; But there is far more to be
said about it.&nbsp; After his wife&rsquo;s death, he withdrew himself
from society for a year or two in a more positive and decided manner
than is common with widowers.&nbsp; It was during this retirement of
his that he riveted his little daughter&rsquo;s heart in such a way
as to influence all her future life.</p>
<p>When he began to go out again, it might have been perceived&mdash;had
any one cared to notice&mdash;how much the different characters of his
father and wife had influenced him and kept him steady.&nbsp; Not that
he broke out into any immoral conduct, but he gave up time to pleasure,
which both old Mr. Wilkins and Lettice would have quietly induced him
to spend in the office, superintending his business.&nbsp; His indulgence
in hunting, and all field sports, had hitherto been only occasional;
they now became habitual, as far as the seasons permitted.&nbsp; He
shared a moor in Scotland with one of the Holsters one year, persuading
himself that the bracing air was good for Ellinor&rsquo;s health.&nbsp;
But the year afterwards he took another, this time joining with a comparative
stranger; and on this moor there was no house to which it was fit to
bring a child and her attendants.&nbsp; He persuaded himself that by
frequent journeys he could make up for his absences from Hamley.&nbsp;
But journeys cost money; and he was often away from his office when
important business required attending to.&nbsp; There was some talk
of a new attorney setting up in Hamley, to be supported by one or two
of the more influential county families, who had found Wilkins not so
attentive as his father.&nbsp; Sir Frank Holster sent for his relation,
and told him of this project, speaking to him, at the same time, in
pretty round terms on the folly of the life he was leading.&nbsp; Foolish
it certainly was, and as such Mr. Wilkins was secretly acknowledging
it; but when Sir Frank, lashing himself, began to talk of his hearer&rsquo;s
presumption in joining the hunt, in aping the mode of life and amusements
of the landed gentry, Edward fired up.&nbsp; He knew how much Sir Frank
was dipped, and comparing it with the round sum his own father had left
him, he said some plain truths to Sir Frank which the latter never forgave,
and henceforth there was no intercourse between Holster Court and Ford
Bank, as Mr. Edward Wilkins had christened his father&rsquo;s house
on his first return from the Continent.</p>
<p>The conversation had two consequences besides the immediate one of
the quarrel.&nbsp; Mr. Wilkins advertised for a responsible and confidential
clerk to conduct the business under his own superintendence; and he
also wrote to the Heralds&rsquo; College to ask if he did not belong
to the family bearing the same name in South Wales&mdash;those who have
since reassumed their ancient name of De Winton.</p>
<p>Both applications were favorably answered.&nbsp; A skilful, experienced,
middle-aged clerk was recommended to him by one of the principal legal
firms in London, and immediately engaged to come to Hamley at his own
terms; which were pretty high.&nbsp; But, as Mr. Wilkins said it was
worth any money to pay for the relief from constant responsibility which
such a business as his involved, some people remarked that he had never
appeared to feel the responsibility very much hitherto, as witness his
absences in Scotland, and his various social engagements when at home;
it had been very different (they said) in his father&rsquo;s day.&nbsp;
The Heralds&rsquo; College held out hopes of affiliating him to the
South Wales family, but it would require time and money to make the
requisite inquiries and substantiate the claim.&nbsp; Now, in many a
place there would be none to contest the right a man might have to assert
that he belonged to such and such a family, or even to assume their
arms.&nbsp; But it was otherwise in ---shire.&nbsp; Everyone was up
in genealogy and heraldry, and considered filching a name and a pedigree
a far worse sin than any of those mentioned on the Commandments.&nbsp;
There were those among them who would doubt and dispute even the decision
of the Heralds&rsquo; College; but with it, if in his favour, Mr. Wilkins
intended to be satisfied, and accordingly he wrote in reply to their
letter to say, that of course he was aware such inquiries would take
a considerable sum of money, but still he wished them to be made, and
that speedily.</p>
<p>Before the end of the year he went up to London to order a brougham
to be built (for Ellinor to drive out in wet weather, he said; but as
going in a closed carriage always made her ill, he used it principally
himself in driving to dinner-parties), with the De Winton Wilkinses&rsquo;
arms neatly emblazoned on panel and harness.&nbsp; Hitherto he had always
gone about in a dog-cart&mdash;the immediate descendant of his father&rsquo;s
old-fashioned gig.</p>
<p>For all this, the squires, his employers, only laughed at him and
did not treat him with one whit more respect.</p>
<p>Mr. Dunster, the new clerk, was a quiet, respectable-looking man;
you could not call him a gentleman in manner, and yet no one could say
he was vulgar.&nbsp; He had not much varying expression on his face,
but a permanent one of thoughtful consideration of the subject in hand,
whatever it might be, that would have fitted as well with the profession
of medicine as with that of law, and was quite the right look for either.&nbsp;
Occasionally a bright flash of sudden intelligence lightened up his
deep-sunk eyes, but even this was quickly extinguished as by some inward
repression, and the habitually reflective, subdued expression returned
to the face.&nbsp; As soon as he came into his situation, he first began
quietly to arrange the papers, and next the business of which they were
the outer sign, into more methodical order than they had been in since
old Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Punctual to a moment himself, he
looked his displeased surprise when the inferior clerks came tumbling
in half an hour after the time in the morning; and his look was more
effective than many men&rsquo;s words; henceforward the subordinates
were within five minutes of the appointed hour for opening the office;
but still he was always there before them.&nbsp; Mr. Wilkins himself
winced under his new clerk&rsquo;s order and punctuality; Mr. Dunster&rsquo;s
raised eyebrow and contraction of the lips at some woeful confusion
in the business of the office, chafed Mr. Wilkins more, far more than
any open expression of opinion would have done; for that he could have
met, and explained away as he fancied.&nbsp; A secret respectful dislike
grew up in his bosom against Mr. Dunster.&nbsp; He esteemed him, he
valued him, and he could not bear him.&nbsp; Year after year Mr. Wilkins
had become more under the influence of his feelings, and less under
the command of his reason.&nbsp; He rather cherished than repressed
his nervous repugnance to the harsh measured tones of Mr. Dunster&rsquo;s
voice; the latter spoke with a provincial twang which grated on his
employer&rsquo;s sensitive ear.&nbsp; He was annoyed at a certain green
coat which his new clerk brought with him, and he watched its increasing
shabbiness with a sort of childish pleasure.&nbsp; But by-and-by Mr.
Wilkins found out that, from some perversity of taste, Mr. Dunster always
had his coats, Sunday and working-day, made of this obnoxious colour;
and this knowledge did not diminish his secret irritation.&nbsp; The
worst of all, perhaps, was, that Mr. Dunster was really invaluable in
many ways; &ldquo;a perfect treasure,&rdquo; as Mr. Wilkins used to
term him in speaking of him after dinner; but, for all that, he came
to hate his &ldquo;perfect treasure,&rdquo; as he gradually felt that
Dunster had become so indispensable to the business that his chief could
not do without him.</p>
<p>The clients re-echoed Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s words, and spoke of Mr.
Dunster as invaluable to his master; a thorough treasure, the very saving
of the business.&nbsp; They had not been better attended to, not even
in old Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s days; such a clear head, such a knowledge
of law, such a steady, upright fellow, always at his post.&nbsp; The
grating voice, the drawling accent, the bottle-green coat, were nothing
to them; far less noticed, in fact, than Wilkins&rsquo;s expensive habits,
the money he paid for his wine and horses, and the nonsense of claiming
kin with the Welsh Wilkinses, and setting up his brougham to drive about
---shire lanes, and be knocked to pieces over the rough round paving-stones
thereof.</p>
<p>All these remarks did not come near Ellinor to trouble her life.&nbsp;
To her, her dear father was the first of human beings; so sweet, so
good, so kind, so charming in conversation, so full of accomplishment
and information!&nbsp; To her healthy, happy mind every one turned their
bright side.&nbsp; She loved Miss Monro&mdash;all the servants&mdash;especially
Dixon, the coachman.&nbsp; He had been her father&rsquo;s playfellow
as a boy, and, with all his respect and admiration for his master, the
freedom of intercourse that had been established between them then had
never been quite lost.&nbsp; Dixon was a fine, stalwart old fellow,
and was as harmonious in his ways with his master as Mr. Dunster was
discordant; accordingly he was a great favourite, and could say many
a thing which might have been taken as impertinent from another servant.</p>
<p>He was Ellinor&rsquo;s great confidant about many of her little plans
and projects; things that she dared not speak of to Mr. Corbet, who,
after her father and Dixon, was her next best friend.&nbsp; This intimacy
with Dixon displeased Mr. Corbet.&nbsp; He once or twice insinuated
that he did not think it was well to talk so familiarly as Ellinor did
with a servant&mdash;one out of a completely different class&mdash;such
as Dixon.&nbsp; Ellinor did not easily take hints; every one had spoken
plain out to her hitherto; so Mr. Corbet had to say his meaning plain
out at last.&nbsp; Then, for the first time, he saw her angry; but she
was too young, too childish, to have words at will to express her feelings;
she only could say broken beginnings of sentences, such as &ldquo;What
a shame!&nbsp; Good, dear Dixon, who is as loyal and true and kind as
any nobleman.&nbsp; I like him far better than you, Mr. Corbet, and
I shall talk to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then she burst into tears and
ran away, and would not come to wish Mr. Corbet good-bye, though she
knew she should not see him again for a long time, as he was returning
the next day to his father&rsquo;s house, from whence he would go to
Cambridge.</p>
<p>He was annoyed at this result of the good advice he had thought himself
bound to give to a motherless girl, who had no one to instruct her in
the proprieties in which his own sisters were brought up; he left Hamley
both sorry and displeased.&nbsp; As for Ellinor, when she found out
the next day that he really was gone&mdash;gone without even coming
to Ford Bank again to see if she were not penitent for her angry words&mdash;gone
without saying or hearing a word of good-bye&mdash;she shut herself
up in her room, and cried more bitterly than ever, because anger against
herself was mixed with her regret for his loss.&nbsp; Luckily, her father
was dining out, or he would have inquired what was the matter with his
darling; and she would have had to try to explain what could not be
explained.&nbsp; As it was, she sat with her back to the light during
the schoolroom tea, and afterwards, when Miss Monro had settled down
to her study of the Spanish language, Ellinor stole out into the garden,
meaning to have a fresh cry over her own naughtiness and Mr. Corbet&rsquo;s
departure; but the August evening was still and calm, and put her passionate
grief to shame, hushing her up, as it were, with the other young creatures,
who were being soothed to rest by the serene time of day, and the subdued
light of the twilight sky.</p>
<p>There was a piece of ground surrounding the flower-garden, which
was not shrubbery, nor wood, nor kitchen garden&mdash;only a grassy
bit, out of which a group of old forest trees sprang.&nbsp; Their roots
were heaved above ground; their leaves fell in autumn so profusely that
the turf was ragged and bare in spring; but, to make up for this, there
never was such a place for snowdrops.</p>
<p>The roots of these old trees were Ellinor&rsquo;s favourite play-place;
this space between these two was her doll&rsquo;s kitchen, that its
drawing-room, and so on.&nbsp; Mr. Corbet rather despised her contrivances
for doll&rsquo;s furniture, so she had not often brought him here; but
Dixon delighted in them, and contrived and planned with the eagerness
of six years old rather than forty.&nbsp; To-night Ellinor went to this
place, and there were all a new collection of ornaments for Miss Dolly&rsquo;s
sitting-room made out of fir-bobs, in the prettiest and most ingenious
way.&nbsp; She knew it was Dixon&rsquo;s doing and rushed off in search
of him to thank him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with my pretty?&rdquo; asked Dixon,
as soon as the pleasant excitement of thanking and being thanked was
over, and he had leisure to look at her tear-stained face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know!&nbsp; Never mind,&rdquo; said she,
reddening.</p>
<p>Dixon was silent for a minute or two, while she tried to turn off
his attention by her hurried prattle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no trouble afoot that I can mend?&rdquo; asked
he, in a minute or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s really nothing&mdash;nothing at all,&rdquo;
said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only that Mr. Corbet went away without
saying good-bye to me, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she looked
as if she should have liked to cry again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was not manners,&rdquo; said Dixon, decisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was my fault,&rdquo; replied Ellinor, pleading against
the condemnation.</p>
<p>Dixon looked at her pretty sharply from under his ragged bushy eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had been giving me a lecture, and saying I didn&rsquo;t
do what his sisters did&mdash;just as if I were to be always trying
to be like somebody else&mdash;and I was cross and ran away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was Missy who wouldn&rsquo;t say good-bye.&nbsp; That
was not manners in Missy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Dixon, I don&rsquo;t like being lectured!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you don&rsquo;t get much of it.&nbsp; But, indeed,
my pretty, I daresay Mr. Corbet was in the right; for, you see, master
is busy, and Miss Monro is so dreadful learned, and your poor mother
is dead and gone, and you have no one to teach you how young ladies
go on; and by all accounts Mr. Corbet comes of a good family.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve heard say his father had the best stud-farm in all Shropshire,
and spared no money upon it; and the young ladies his sisters will have
been taught the best of manners; it might be well for my pretty to hear
how they go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dear old Dixon, you don&rsquo;t know anything about my
lecture, and I&rsquo;m not going to tell you.&nbsp; Only I daresay Mr.
Corbet might be a little bit right, though I&rsquo;m sure he was a great
deal wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll not go on a-fretting&mdash;you won&rsquo;t
now, there&rsquo;s a good young lady&mdash;for master won&rsquo;t like
it, and it&rsquo;ll make him uneasy, and he&rsquo;s enough of trouble
without your red eyes, bless them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble&mdash;papa, trouble!&nbsp; Oh, Dixon! what do you
mean?&rdquo; exclaimed Ellinor, her face taking all a woman&rsquo;s
intensity of expression in a minute.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, I know nought,&rdquo; said Dixon, evasively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Only that Dunster fellow is not to my mind, and I think he potters
the master sadly with his fid-fad ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate Mr. Dunster!&rdquo; said Ellinor, vehemently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t speak a word to him the next time he comes to dine
with papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Missy will do what papa likes best,&rdquo; said Dixon, admonishingly;
and with this the pair of &ldquo;friends&rdquo; parted,</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p>The summer afterwards Mr. Corbet came again to read with Mr. Ness.&nbsp;
He did not perceive any alteration in himself, and indeed his early-matured
character had hardly made progress during the last twelve months whatever
intellectual acquirements he might have made.&nbsp; Therefore it was
astonishing to him to see the alteration in Ellinor Wilkins.&nbsp; She
had shot up from a rather puny girl to a tall, slight young lady, with
promise of great beauty in the face, which a year ago had only been
remarkable for the fineness of the eyes.&nbsp; Her complexion was clear
now, although colourless&mdash;twelve months ago he would have called
it sallow&mdash;her delicate cheek was smooth as marble, her teeth were
even and white, and her rare smiles called out a lovely dimple.</p>
<p>She met her former friend and lecturer with a grave shyness, for
she remembered well how they had parted, and thought he could hardly
have forgiven, much less forgotten, her passionate flinging away from
him.&nbsp; But the truth was, after the first few hours of offended
displeasure, he had ceased to think of it at all.&nbsp; She, poor child,
by way of proving her repentance, had tried hard to reform her boisterous
tom-boy manners, in order to show him that, although she would not give
up her dear old friend Dixon, at his or anyone&rsquo;s bidding, she
would strive to profit by his lectures in all things reasonable.&nbsp;
The consequence was, that she suddenly appeared to him as an elegant
dignified young lady, instead of the rough little girl he remembered.&nbsp;
Still below her somewhat formal manners there lurked the old wild spirit,
as he could plainly see after a little more watching; and he began to
wish to call this out, and to strive, by reminding her of old days,
and all her childish frolics, to flavour her subdued manners and speech
with a little of the former originality.</p>
<p>In this he succeeded.&nbsp; No one, neither Mr. Wilkins, nor Miss
Monro, nor Mr. Ness, saw what this young couple were about&mdash;they
did not know it themselves; but before the summer was over they were
desperately in love with each other, or perhaps I should rather say,
Ellinor was desperately in love with him&mdash;he, as passionately as
he could be with anyone; but in him the intellect was superior in strength
to either affections or passions.</p>
<p>The causes of the blindness of those around them were these: Mr.
Wilkins still considered Ellinor as a little girl, as his own pet, his
darling, but nothing more.&nbsp; Miss Monro was anxious about her own
improvement.&nbsp; Mr. Ness was deep in a new edition of &ldquo;Horace,&rdquo;
which he was going to bring out with notes.&nbsp; I believe Dixon would
have been keener sighted, but Ellinor kept Mr. Corbet and Dixon apart
for obvious reasons&mdash;they were each her dear friends, but she knew
that Mr. Corbet did not like Dixon, and suspected that the feeling was
mutual.</p>
<p>The only change of circumstances between this year and the previous
one consisted in this development of attachment between the young people.&nbsp;
Otherwise, everything went on apparently as usual.&nbsp; With Ellinor
the course of the day was something like this: up early and into the
garden until breakfast time, when she made tea for her father and Miss
Monro in the dining-room, always taking care to lay a little nosegay
of freshly-gathered flowers by her father&rsquo;s plate.&nbsp; After
breakfast, when the conversation had been on general and indifferent
subjects, Mr. Wilkins withdrew into the little study so often mentioned.&nbsp;
It opened out of a passage that ran between the dining-room and the
kitchen, on the left hand of the hall.&nbsp; Corresponding to the dining-room
on the other side of the hall was the drawing-room, with its side-window
serving as a door into a conservatory, and this again opened into the
library.&nbsp; Old Mr. Wilkins had added a semicircular projection to
the library, which was lighted by a dome above, and showed off his son&rsquo;s
Italian purchases of sculpture.&nbsp; The library was by far the most
striking and agreeable room in the house; and the consequence was that
the drawing-room was seldom used, and had the aspect of cold discomfort
common to apartments rarely occupied.&nbsp; Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s study,
on the other side of the house, was also an afterthought, built only
a few years ago, and projecting from the regularity of the outside wall;
a little stone passage led to it from the hall, small, narrow, and dark,
and out of which no other door opened.</p>
<p>The study itself was a hexagon, one side window, one fireplace, and
the remaining four sides occupied with doors, two of which have been
already mentioned, another at the foot of the narrow winding stairs
which led straight into Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s bedroom over the dining-room,
and the fourth opening into a path through the shrubbery to the right
of the flower-garden as you looked from the house.&nbsp; This path led
through the stable-yard, and then by a short cut right into Hamley,
and brought you out close to Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s office; it was by this
way he always went and returned to his business.&nbsp; He used the study
for a smoking and lounging room principally, although he always spoke
of it as a convenient place for holding confidential communications
with such of his clients as did not like discussing their business within
the possible hearing of all the clerks in his office.&nbsp; By the outer
door he could also pass to the stables, and see that proper care was
taken at all times of his favourite and valuable horses.&nbsp; Into
this study Ellinor would follow him of a morning, helping him on with
his great-coat, mending his gloves, talking an infinite deal of merry
fond nothing; and then, clinging to his arm, she would accompany him
in his visits to the stables, going up to the shyest horses, and petting
them, and patting them, and feeding them with bread all the time that
her father held converse with Dixon.&nbsp; When he was finally gone&mdash;and
sometimes it was a long time first&mdash;she returned to the schoolroom
to Miss Monro, and tried to set herself hard at work on her lessons.&nbsp;
But she had not much time for steady application; if her father had
cared for her progress in anything, she would and could have worked
hard at that study or accomplishment; but Mr. Wilkins, the ease and
pleasure loving man, did not wish to make himself into the pedagogue,
as he would have considered it, if he had ever questioned Ellinor with
a real steady purpose of ascertaining her intellectual progress.&nbsp;
It was quite enough for him that her general intelligence and variety
of desultory and miscellaneous reading made her a pleasant and agreeable
companion for his hours of relaxation.</p>
<p>At twelve o&rsquo;clock, Ellinor put away her books with joyful eagerness,
kissed Miss Monro, asked her if they should go a regular walk, and was
always rather thankful when it was decided that it would be better to
stroll in the garden&mdash;a decision very often come to, for Miss Monro
hated fatigue, hated dirt, hated scrambling, and dreaded rain; all of
which are evils, the chances of which are never far distant from country
walks.&nbsp; So Ellinor danced out into the garden, worked away among
her flowers, played at the old games among the roots of the trees, and,
when she could, seduced Dixon into the flower-garden to have a little
consultation as to the horses and dogs.&nbsp; For it was one of her
father&rsquo;s few strict rules that Ellinor was never to go into the
stable-yard unless he were with her; so these <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes</i>
with Dixon were always held in the flower-garden, or bit of forest ground
surrounding it.&nbsp; Miss Monro sat and basked in the sun, close to
the dial, which made the centre of the gay flower-beds, upon which the
dining-room and study windows looked.</p>
<p>At one o&rsquo;clock, Ellinor and Miss Monro dined.&nbsp; An hour
was allowed for Miss Monro&rsquo;s digestion, which Ellinor again spent
out of doors, and at three, lessons began again and lasted till five.&nbsp;
At that time they went to dress preparatory for the schoolroom tea at
half-past five.&nbsp; After tea Ellinor tried to prepare her lessons
for the next day; but all the time she was listening for her father&rsquo;s
footstep&mdash;the moment she heard that, she dashed down her book,
and flew out of the room to welcome and kiss him.&nbsp; Seven was his
dinner-hour; he hardly ever dined alone; indeed, he often dined from
home four days out of seven, and when he had no engagement to take him
out he liked to have some one to keep him company: Mr. Ness very often,
Mr. Corbet along with him if he was in Hamley, a stranger friend, or
one of his clients.&nbsp; Sometimes, reluctantly, and when he fancied
he could not avoid the attention without giving offence, Mr. Wilkins
would ask Mr. Dunster, and then the two would always follow Ellinor
into the library at a very early hour, as if their subjects for <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>
conversation were quite exhausted.&nbsp; With all his other visitors,
Mr. Wilkins sat long&mdash;yes, and yearly longer; with Mr. Ness, because
they became interested in each other&rsquo;s conversation; with some
of the others, because the wine was good, and the host hated to spare
it.</p>
<p>Mr. Corbet used to leave his tutor and Mr. Wilkins and saunter into
the library.&nbsp; There sat Ellinor and Miss Monro, each busy with
their embroidery.&nbsp; He would bring a stool to Ellinor&rsquo;s side,
question and tease her, interest her, and they would become entirely
absorbed in each other, Miss Monro&rsquo;s sense of propriety being
entirely set at rest by the consideration that Mr. Wilkins must know
what he was about in allowing a young man to become thus intimate with
his daughter, who, after all, was but a child.</p>
<p>Mr. Corbet had lately fallen into the habit of walking up to Ford
Bank for <i>The Times</i> every day, near twelve o&rsquo;clock, and
lounging about in the garden until one; not exactly with either Ellinor
or Miss Monro, but certainly far more at the beck and call of the one
than of the other.</p>
<p>Miss Monro used to think he would have been glad to stay and lunch
at their early dinner, but she never gave the invitation, and he could
not well stay without her expressed sanction.&nbsp; He told Ellinor
all about his mother and sisters, and their ways of going on, and spoke
of them and of his father as of people she was one day certain to know,
and to know intimately; and she did not question or doubt this view
of things; she simply acquiesced.</p>
<p>He had some discussion with himself as to whether he should speak
to her, and so secure her promise to be his before returning to Cambridge
or not.&nbsp; He did not like the formality of an application to Mr.
Wilkins, which would, after all, have been the proper and straightforward
course to pursue with a girl of her age&mdash;she was barely sixteen.&nbsp;
Not that he anticipated any difficulty on Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s part;
his approval of the intimacy which at their respective ages was pretty
sure to lead to an attachment, was made as evident as could be by actions
without words.&nbsp; But there would have to be reference to his own
father, who had no notion of the whole affair, and would be sure to
treat it as a boyish fancy; as if at twenty-one Ralph was not a man,
as clear and deliberative in knowing his own mind, as resolute as he
ever would be in deciding upon the course of exertion that should lead
him to independence and fame, if such were to be attained by clear intellect
and a strong will.</p>
<p>No; to Mr. Wilkins he would not speak for another year or two.</p>
<p>But should he tell Ellinor in direct terms of his love&mdash;his
intention to marry her?</p>
<p>Again he inclined to the more prudent course of silence.&nbsp; He
was not afraid of any change in his own inclinations: of them he was
sure.&nbsp; But he looked upon it in this way: If he made a regular
declaration to her she would be bound to tell it to her father.&nbsp;
He should not respect her or like her so much if she did not.&nbsp;
And yet this course would lead to all the conversations, and discussions,
and references to his own father, which made his own direct appeal to
Mr. Wilkins appear a premature step to him.</p>
<p>Whereas he was as sure of Ellinor&rsquo;s love for him as if she
had uttered all the vows that women ever spoke; he knew even better
than she did how fully and entirely that innocent girlish heart was
his own.&nbsp; He was too proud to dread her inconstancy for an instant;
&ldquo;besides,&rdquo; as he went on to himself, as if to make assurance
doubly sure, &ldquo;whom does she see?&nbsp; Those stupid Holsters,
who ought to be only too proud of having such a girl for their cousin,
ignore her existence, and spoke slightingly of her father only the very
last time I dined there.&nbsp; The country people in this precisely
Boeotian ---shire clutch at me because my father goes up to the Plantagenets
for his pedigree&mdash;not one whit for myself&mdash;and neglect Ellinor;
and only condescend to her father because old Wilkins was nobody-knows-who&rsquo;s
son.&nbsp; So much the worse for them, but so much the better for me
in this case.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m above their silly antiquated prejudices,
and shall be only too glad when the fitting time comes to make Ellinor
my wife.&nbsp; After all, a prosperous attorney&rsquo;s daughter may
not be considered an unsuitable match for me&mdash;younger son as I
am.&nbsp; Ellinor will make a glorious woman three or four years hence;
just the style my father admires&mdash;such a figure, such limbs.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll be patient, and bide my time, and watch my opportunities,
and all will come right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he bade Ellinor farewell in a most reluctant and affectionate
manner, although his words might have been spoken out in Hamley market-place,
and were little different from what he said to Miss Monro.&nbsp; Mr.
Wilkins half expected a disclosure to himself of the love which he suspected
in the young man; and when that did not come, he prepared himself for
a confidence from Ellinor.&nbsp; But she had nothing to tell him, as
he very well perceived from the child&rsquo;s open unembarrassed manner
when they were left alone together after dinner.&nbsp; He had refused
an invitation, and shaken off Mr. Ness, in order to have this confidential
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with his motherless girl; and
there was nothing to make confidence of.&nbsp; He was half inclined
to be angry; but then he saw that, although sad, she was so much at
peace with herself and with the world, that he, always an optimist,
began to think the young man had done wisely in not tearing open the
rosebud of her feelings too prematurely.</p>
<p>The next two years passed over in much the same way&mdash;or a careless
spectator might have thought so.&nbsp; I have heard people say, that
if you look at a regiment advancing with steady step over a plain on
a review-day, you can hardly tell that they are not merely marking time
on one spot of ground, unless you compare their position with some other
object by which to mark their progress, so even is the repetition of
the movement.&nbsp; And thus the sad events of the future life of this
father and daughter were hardly perceived in their steady advance, and
yet over the monotony and flat uniformity of their days sorrow came
marching down upon them like an armed man.&nbsp; Long before Mr. Wilkins
had recognised its shape, it was approaching him in the distance&mdash;as,
in fact, it is approaching all of us at this very time; you, reader,
I, writer, have each our great sorrow bearing down upon us.&nbsp; It
may be yet beyond the dimmest point of our horizon, but in the stillness
of the night our hearts shrink at the sound of its coming footstep.&nbsp;
Well is it for those who fall into the hands of the Lord rather than
into the hands of men; but worst of all is it for him who has hereafter
to mingle the gall of remorse with the cup held out to him by his doom.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilkins took his ease and his pleasure yet more and more every
year of his life; nor did the quality of his ease and his pleasure improve;
it seldom does with self-indulgent people.&nbsp; He cared less for any
books that strained his faculties a little&mdash;less for engravings
and sculptures&mdash;perhaps more for pictures.&nbsp; He spent extravagantly
on his horses; &ldquo;thought of eating and drinking.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
was no open vice in all this, so that any awful temptation to crime
should come down upon him, and startle him out of his mode of thinking
and living; half the people about him did much the same, as far as their
lives were patent to his unreflecting observation.&nbsp; But most of
his associates had their duties to do, and did them with a heart and
a will, in the hours when he was not in their company.&nbsp; Yes! I
call them duties, though some of them might be self-imposed and purely
social; they were engagements they had entered into, either tacitly
or with words, and that they fulfilled.&nbsp; From Mr. Hetherington,
the Master of the Hounds, who was up at&mdash;no one knows what hour,
to go down to the kennel and see that the men did their work well and
thoroughly, to stern old Sir Lionel Playfair, the upright magistrate,
the thoughtful, conscientious landlord&mdash;they did their work according
to their lights; there were few laggards among those with whom Mr. Wilkins
associated in the field or at the dinner-table.&nbsp; Mr. Ness&mdash;though
as a clergyman he was not so active as he might have been&mdash;yet
even Mr. Ness fagged away with his pupils and his new edition of one
of the classics.&nbsp; Only Mr. Wilkins, dissatisfied with his position,
neglected to fulfil the duties thereof.&nbsp; He imitated the pleasures,
and longed for the fancied leisure of those about him; leisure that
he imagined would be so much more valuable in the hands of a man like
himself, full of intellectual tastes and accomplishments, than frittered
away by dull boors of untravelled, uncultivated squires&mdash;whose
company, however, be it said by the way, he never refused.</p>
<p>And yet daily Mr. Wilkins was sinking from the intellectually to
the sensually self-indulgent man.&nbsp; He lay late in bed, and hated
Mr. Dunster for his significant glance at the office-clock when he announced
to his master that such and such a client had been waiting more than
an hour to keep an appointment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you see
him yourself, Dunster?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure you would have done quite
as well as me,&rdquo; Mr. Wilkins sometimes replied, partly with a view
of saying something pleasant to the man whom he disliked and feared.&nbsp;
Mr. Dunster always replied, in a meek matter-of-fact tone, &ldquo;Oh,
sir, they wouldn&rsquo;t like to talk over their affairs with a subordinate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And every time he said this, or some speech of the same kind, the
idea came more and more clearly into Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s head, of how
pleasant it would be to himself to take Dunster into partnership, and
thus throw all the responsibility of the real work and drudgery upon
his clerk&rsquo;s shoulders.&nbsp; Importunate clients, who would make
appointments at unseasonable hours and would keep to them, might confide
in the partner, though they would not in the clerk.&nbsp; The great
objections to this course were, first and foremost, Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s
strong dislike to Mr. Dunster&mdash;his repugnance to his company, his
dress, his voice, his ways&mdash;all of which irritated his employer,
till his state of feeling towards Dunster might be called antipathy;
next, Mr. Wilkins was fully aware of the fact that all Mr. Dunster&rsquo;s
actions and words were carefully and thoughtfully pre-arranged to further
the great unspoken desire of his life&mdash;that of being made a partner
where he now was only a servant.&nbsp; Mr. Wilkins took a malicious
pleasure in tantalizing Mr. Dunster by such speeches as the one I have
just mentioned, which always seemed like an opening to the desired end,
but still for a long time never led any further.&nbsp; Yet all the while
that end was becoming more and more certain, and at last it was reached.</p>
<p>Mr. Dunster always suspected that the final push was given by some
circumstance from without; some reprimand for neglect&mdash;some threat
of withdrawal of business which his employer had received; but of this
he could not be certain; all he knew was, that Mr. Wilkins proposed
the partnership to him in about as ungracious a way as such an offer
could be made; an ungraciousness which, after all, had so little effect
on the real matter in hand, that Mr. Dunster could pass over it with
a private sneer, while taking all possible advantage of the tangible
benefit it was now in his power to accept.</p>
<p>Mr. Corbet&rsquo;s attachment to Ellinor had been formally disclosed
to her just before this time.&nbsp; He had left college, entered at
the Middle Temple, and was fagging away at law, and feeling success
in his own power; Ellinor was to &ldquo;come out&rdquo; at the next
Hamley assemblies; and her lover began to be jealous of the possible
admirers her striking appearance and piquant conversation might attract,
and thought it a good time to make the success of his suit certain by
spoken words and promises.</p>
<p>He needed not have alarmed himself even enough to make him take this
step, if he had been capable of understanding Ellinor&rsquo;s heart
as fully as he did her appearance and conversation.&nbsp; She never
missed the absence of formal words and promises.&nbsp; She considered
herself as fully engaged to him, as much pledged to marry him and no
one else, before he had asked the final question, as afterwards.&nbsp;
She was rather surprised at the necessity for those decisive words,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellinor, dearest, will you&mdash;can you marry me?&rdquo;
and her reply was&mdash;given with a deep blush I must record, and in
a soft murmuring tone&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;oh, yes&mdash;I never thought of anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I may speak to your father, may not I, darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows; I am sure he knows; and he likes you so much.&nbsp;
Oh, how happy I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But still I must speak to him before I go.&nbsp; When can
I see him, my Ellinor?&nbsp; I must go back to town at four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard his voice in the stable-yard only just before you
came.&nbsp; Let me go and find out if he is gone to the office yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No! to be sure he was not gone.&nbsp; He was quietly smoking a cigar
in his study, sitting in an easy-chair near the open window, and leisurely
glancing at all the advertisements in <i>The Times</i>.&nbsp; He hated
going to the office more and more since Dunster had become a partner;
that fellow gave himself such airs of investigation and reprehension.</p>
<p>He got up, took the cigar out of his mouth, and placed a chair for
Mr. Corbet, knowing well why he had thus formally prefaced his entrance
into the room with a&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I have a few minutes&rsquo; conversation with you, Mr.
Wilkins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, my dear fellow.&nbsp; Sit down.&nbsp; Will you
have a cigar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; I never smoke.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Corbet despised
all these kinds of indulgences, and put a little severity into his refusal,
but quite unintentionally; for though he was thankful he was not as
other men, he was not at all the person to trouble himself unnecessarily
with their reformation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to speak to you about Ellinor.&nbsp; She says she thinks
you must be aware of our mutual attachment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilkins&mdash;he had resumed his cigar,
partly to conceal his agitation at what he knew was coming&mdash;&ldquo;I
believe I have had my suspicions.&nbsp; It is not very long since I
was young myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he sighed over the recollection of
Lettice, and his fresh, hopeful youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I hope, sir, as you have been aware of it, and have never
manifested any disapprobation of it, that you will not refuse your consent&mdash;a
consent I now ask you for&mdash;to our marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wilkins did not speak for a little while&mdash;a touch, a thought,
a word more would have brought him to tears; for at the last he found
it hard to give the consent which would part him from his only child.&nbsp;
Suddenly he got up, and putting his hand into that of the anxious lover
(for his silence had rendered Mr. Corbet anxious up to a certain point
of perplexity&mdash;he could not understand the implied he would and
he would not), Mr. Wilkins said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&nbsp; God bless you both!&nbsp; I will give her to you,
some day&mdash;only it must be a long time first.&nbsp; And now go away&mdash;go
back to her&mdash;for I can&rsquo;t stand this much longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Corbet returned to Ellinor.&nbsp; Mr. Wilkins sat down and buried
his head in his hands, then went to his stable, and had Wildfire saddled
for a good gallop over the country.&nbsp; Mr. Dunster waited for him
in vain at the office, where an obstinate old country gentleman from
a distant part of the shire would ignore Dunster&rsquo;s existence as
a partner, and pertinaciously demanded to see Mr. Wilkins on important
business.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p>A few days afterwards, Ellinor&rsquo;s father bethought himself that
same further communication ought to take place between him and his daughter&rsquo;s
lover regarding the approval of the family of the latter to the young
man&rsquo;s engagement, and he accordingly wrote a very gentlemanly
letter, saying that of course he trusted that Ralph had informed his
father of his engagement; that Mr. Corbet was well known to Mr. Wilkins
by reputation, holding the position which he did in Shropshire, but
that as Mr. Wilkins did not pretend to be in the same station of life,
Mr. Corbet might possibly never even have heard of his name, although
in his own county it was well known as having been for generations that
of the principal conveyancer and land-agent of ---shire; that his wife
had been a member of the old knightly family of Holsters, and that he
himself was descended from a younger branch of the South Wales De Wintons,
or Wilkins; that Ellinor, as his only child, would naturally inherit
all his property, but that in the meantime, of course, some settlement
upon her would be made, the nature of which might be decided nearer
the time of the marriage.</p>
<p>It was a very good straightforward letter and well fitted for the
purpose to which Mr. Wilkins knew it would be applied&mdash;of being
forwarded to the young man&rsquo;s father.&nbsp; One would have thought
that it was not an engagement so disproportionate in point of station
as to cause any great opposition on that score; but, unluckily, Captain
Corbet, the heir and eldest son, had just formed a similar engagement
with Lady Maria Brabant, the daughter of one of the proudest earls in
---shire, who had always resented Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s appearance on
the field as an insult to the county, and ignored his presence at every
dinner-table where they met.&nbsp; Lady Maria was visiting the Corbets
at the very time when Ralph&rsquo;s letter, enclosing Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s,
reached the paternal halls, and she merely repeated her father&rsquo;s
opinions when Mrs. Corbet and her daughters naturally questioned her
as to who these Wilkinses were; they remembered the name in Ralph&rsquo;s
letters formerly; the father was some friend of Mr. Ness&rsquo;s, the
clergyman with whom Ralph had read; they believed Ralph used to dine
with these Wilkinses sometimes, along with Mr. Ness.</p>
<p>Lady Maria was a goodnatured girl, and meant no harm in repeating
her father&rsquo;s words; touched up, it is true, by some of the dislike
she herself felt to the intimate alliance proposed, which would make
her sister-in-law to the daughter of an &ldquo;upstart attorney,&rdquo;
&ldquo;not received in the county,&rdquo; &ldquo;always trying to push
his way into the set above him,&rdquo; &ldquo;claiming connection with
the De Wintons of --- Castle, who, as she well knew, only laughed when
he was spoken of, and said they were more rich in relations than they
were aware of&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;not people papa would ever like her
to know, whatever might be the family connection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These little speeches told in a way which the girl who uttered them
did not intend they should.&nbsp; Mrs. Corbet and her daughters set
themselves violently against this foolish entanglement of Ralph&rsquo;s;
they would not call it an engagement.&nbsp; They argued, and they urged,
and they pleaded, till the squire, anxious for peace at any price, and
always more under the sway of the people who were with him, however
unreasonable they might be, than of the absent, even though these had
the wisdom of Solomon or the prudence and sagacity of his son Ralph,
wrote an angry letter, saying that, as Ralph was of age, of course he
had a right to please himself, therefore all his father could say was,
that the engagement was not at all what either he or Ralph&rsquo;s mother
had expected or hoped; that it was a degradation to the family just
going to ally themselves with a peer of James the First&rsquo;s creation;
that of course Ralph must do what he liked, but that if he married this
girl he must never expect to have her received by the Corbets of Corbet
Hall as a daughter.&nbsp; The squire was rather satisfied with his production,
and took it to show it to his wife; but she did not think it was strong
enough, and added a little postscript</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;DEAR RALPH,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though, as second son, you are entitled to Bromley at my death,
yet I can do much to make the estate worthless.&nbsp; Hitherto, regard
for you has prevented my taking steps as to sale of timber, &amp;c.,
which would materially increase your sisters&rsquo; portions; this just
measure I shall infallibly take if I find you persevere in keeping to
this silly engagement.&nbsp; Your father&rsquo;s disapproval is always
a sufficient reason to allege.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ralph was annoyed at the receipt of these letters, though he only
smiled as he locked them up in his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear old father! how he blusters!&nbsp; As to my mother, she
is reasonable when I talk to her.&nbsp; Once give her a definite idea
of what Ellinor&rsquo;s fortune will be, and let her, if she chooses,
cut down her timber&mdash;a threat she has held over me ever since I
knew what a rocking-horse was, and which I have known to be illegal
these ten years past&mdash;and she&rsquo;ll come round.&nbsp; I know
better than they do how Reginald has run up post-obits, and as for that
vulgar high-born Lady Maria they are all so full of, why, she is a Flanders
mare to my Ellinor, and has not a silver penny to cross herself with,
besides!&nbsp; I bide my time, you dear good people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not think it necessary to reply to these letters immediately,
nor did he even allude to their contents in his to Ellinor.&nbsp; Mr.
Wilkins, who had been very well satisfied with his own letter to the
young man, and had thought that it must be equally agreeable to every
one, was not at all suspicious of any disapproval, because the fact
of a distinct sanction on the part of Mr. Ralph Corbet&rsquo;s friends
to his engagement was not communicated to him.</p>
<p>As for Ellinor, she trembled all over with happiness.&nbsp; Such
a summer for the blossoming of flowers and ripening of fruit had not
been known for years; it seemed to her as if bountiful loving Nature
wanted to fill the cup of Ellinor&rsquo;s joy to overflowing, and as
if everything, animate and inanimate, sympathised with her happiness.&nbsp;
Her father was well, and apparently content.&nbsp; Miss Monro was very
kind.&nbsp; Dixon&rsquo;s lameness was quite gone off.&nbsp; Only Mr.
Dunster came creeping about the house, on pretence of business, seeking
out her father, and disturbing all his leisure with his dust-coloured
parchment-skinned careworn face, and seeming to disturb the smooth current
of her daily life whenever she saw him.</p>
<p>Ellinor made her appearance at the Hamley assemblies, but with less
<i>&eacute;clat</i> than either her father or her lover expected.&nbsp;
Her beauty and natural grace were admired by those who could discriminate;
but to the greater number there was (what they called) &ldquo;a want
of style&rdquo;&mdash;want of elegance there certainly was not, for
her figure was perfect, and though she moved shyly, she moved well.&nbsp;
Perhaps it was not a good place for a correct appreciation of Miss Wilkins;
some of the old dowagers thought it a piece of presumption in her to
be there at all&mdash;but the Lady Holster of the day (who remembered
her husband&rsquo;s quarrel with Mr. Wilkins, and looked away whenever
Ellinor came near) resented this opinion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss Wilkins
is descended from Sir Frank&rsquo;s family, one of the oldest in the
county; the objection might have been made years ago to the father,
but as he had been received, she did not know why Miss Wilkins was to
be alluded to as out of her place.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ellinor&rsquo;s greatest
enjoyment in the evening was to hear her father say, after all was over,
and they were driving home&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought my Nelly the prettiest girl there, and I think
I know some other people who would have said the same if they could
have spoken out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, papa,&rdquo; said Ellinor, squeezing his hand,
which she held.&nbsp; She thought he alluded to the absent Ralph as
the person who would have agreed with him, had he had the opportunity
of seeing her; but no, he seldom thought much of the absent; but had
been rather flattered by seeing Lord Hildebrand take up his glass for
the apparent purpose of watching Ellinor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your pearls, too, were as handsome as any in the room, child&mdash;but
we must have them re-set; the sprays are old-fashioned now.&nbsp; Let
me have them to-morrow to send up to Hancock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, please, I had rather keep them as they are&mdash;as
mamma wore them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was touched in a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, darling.&nbsp; God bless you for thinking of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he ordered her a set of sapphires instead, for the next assembly.</p>
<p>These balls were not such as to intoxicate Ellinor with success,
and make her in love with gaiety.&nbsp; Large parties came from the
different country-houses in the neighbourhood, and danced with each
other.&nbsp; When they had exhausted the resources they brought with
them, they had generally a few dances to spare for friends of the same
standing with whom they were most intimate.&nbsp; Ellinor came with
her father, and joined an old card-playing dowager, by way of a chaperone&mdash;the
said dowager being under old business obligations to the firm of Wilkins
and Son, and apologizing to all her acquaintances for her own weak condescension
to Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s foible in wishing to introduce his daughter into
society above her natural sphere.&nbsp; It was upon this lady, after
she had uttered some such speech as the one I have just mentioned, that
Lady Holster had come down with the pedigree of Ellinor&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp;
But though the old dowager had drawn back a little discomfited at my
lady&rsquo;s reply, she was not more attentive to Ellinor in consequence.&nbsp;
She allowed Mr. Wilkins to bring in his daughter and place her on the
crimson sofa beside her; spoke to her occasionally in the interval that
elapsed before the rubbers could be properly arranged in the card-room;
invited the girl to accompany her to that sober amusement, and on Ellinor&rsquo;s
declining, and preferring to remain with her father, the dowager left
her with a sweet smile on her plump countenance, and an approving conscience
somewhere within her portly frame, assuring her that she had done all
that could possibly have been expected from her towards &ldquo;that
good Wilkins&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ellinor stood by her father
watching the dances, and thankful for the occasional chance of a dance.&nbsp;
While she had been sitting by her chaperone, Mr. Wilkins had made the
tour of the room, dropping out the little fact of his daughter&rsquo;s
being present wherever he thought the seed likely to bring forth the
fruit of partners.&nbsp; And some came because they liked Mr. Wilkins,
and some asked Ellinor because they had done their duty dances to their
own party, and might please themselves.&nbsp; So that she usually had
an average of one invitation to every three dances; and this principally
towards the end of the evening.</p>
<p>But considering her real beauty, and the care which her father always
took about her appearance, she met with far less than her due of admiration.&nbsp;
Admiration she did not care for; partners she did; and sometimes felt
mortified when she had to sit or stand quiet during all the first part
of the evening.&nbsp; If it had not been for her father&rsquo;s wishes
she would much rather have stayed at home; but, nevertheless, she talked
even to the irresponsive old dowager, and fairly chatted to her father
when she got beside him, because she did not like him to fancy that
she was not enjoying herself.</p>
<p>And, indeed, she had so much happiness in the daily course of this
part of her life, that, on looking back upon it afterwards, she could
not imagine anything brighter than it had been.&nbsp; The delight of
receiving her lover&rsquo;s letters&mdash;the anxious happiness of replying
to them (always a little bit fearful lest she should not express herself
and her love in the precisely happy medium becoming a maiden)&mdash;the
father&rsquo;s love and satisfaction in her&mdash;the calm prosperity
of the whole household&mdash;was delightful at the time, and, looking
back upon it, it was dreamlike.</p>
<p>Occasionally Mr. Corbet came down to see her.&nbsp; He always slept
on these occasions at Mr. Ness&rsquo;s; but he was at Ford Bank the
greater part of the one day between two nights that he allowed himself
for the length of his visits.&nbsp; And even these short peeps were
not frequently taken.&nbsp; He was working hard at law: fagging at it
tooth and nail; arranging his whole life so as best to promote the ends
of his ambition; feeling a delight in surpassing and mastering his fellows&mdash;those
who started in the race at the same time.&nbsp; He read Ellinor&rsquo;s
letters over and over again; nothing else beside law-books.&nbsp; He
perceived the repressed love hidden away in subdued expressions in her
communications, with an amused pleasure at the attempt at concealment.&nbsp;
He was glad that her gaieties were not more gay; he was glad that she
was not too much admired, although a little indignant at the want of
taste on the part of the ---shire gentlemen.&nbsp; But if other admirers
had come prominently forward, he would have had to take some more decided
steps to assert his rights than he had hitherto done; for he had caused
Ellinor to express a wish to her father that her engagement should not
be too much talked about until nearer the time when it would be prudent
for him to marry her.&nbsp; He thought that the knowledge of this, the
only imprudently hasty step he ever meant to take in his life, might
go against his character for wisdom, if the fact became known while
he was as yet only a student.&nbsp; Mr. Wilkins wondered a little; but
acceded, as he always did, to any of Ellinor&rsquo;s requests.&nbsp;
Mr. Ness was a confidant, of course, and some of Lady Maria&rsquo;s
connections heard of it, and forgot it again very soon; and, as it happened,
no one else was sufficiently interested in Ellinor to care to ascertain
the fact.</p>
<p>All this time, Mr. Ralph Corbet maintained a very quietly decided
attitude towards his own family.&nbsp; He was engaged to Miss Wilkins;
and all he could say was, he felt sorry that they disapproved of it.&nbsp;
He was not able to marry just at present, and before the time for his
marriage arrived, he trusted that his family would take a more reasonable
view of things, and be willing to receive her as his wife with all becoming
respect or affection.&nbsp; This was the substance of what he repeated
in different forms in reply to his father&rsquo;s angry letters.&nbsp;
At length, his invariable determination made way with his father; the
paternal thunderings were subdued to a distant rumbling in the sky;
and presently the inquiry was broached as to how much fortune Miss Wilkins
would have; how much down on her marriage; what were the eventual probabilities.&nbsp;
Now this was a point which Mr. Ralph Corbet himself wished to be informed
upon.&nbsp; He had not thought much about it in making the engagement;
he had been too young, or too much in love.&nbsp; But an only child
of a wealthy attorney ought to have something considerable; and an allowance
so as to enable the young couple to start housekeeping in a moderately
good part of town, would be an advantage to him in his profession.&nbsp;
So he replied to his father, adroitly suggesting that a letter containing
certain modifications of the inquiry which had been rather roughly put
in Mr. Corbet&rsquo;s last, should be sent to him, in order that he
might himself ascertain from Mr. Wilkins what were Ellinor&rsquo;s prospects
as regarded fortune.</p>
<p>The desired letter came; but not in such a form that he could pass
it on to Mr. Wilkins; he preferred to make quotations, and even these
quotations were a little altered and dressed before he sent them on.&nbsp;
The gist of his letter to Mr. Wilkins was this.&nbsp; He stated that
he hoped soon to be in a position to offer Ellinor a home; that he anticipated
a steady progress in his profession, and consequently in his income;
but that contingencies might arise, as his father suggested, which would
deprive him of the power of earning a livelihood, perhaps when it might
be more required than it would be at first; that it was true that, after
his mother&rsquo;s death a small estate in Shropshire would come to
him as second son, and of course Ellinor would receive the benefit of
this property, secured to her legally as Mr. Wilkins thought best&mdash;that
being a matter for after discussion&mdash;but that at present his father
was anxious, as might be seen from the extract to ascertain whether
Mr. Wilkins could secure him from the contingency of having his son&rsquo;s
widow and possible children thrown upon his hands, by giving Ellinor
a dowry; and if so, it was gently insinuated, what would be the amount
of the same.</p>
<p>When Mr. Wilkins received this letter it startled him out of a happy
day-dream.&nbsp; He liked Ralph Corbet and the whole connection quite
well enough to give his consent to an engagement; and sometimes even
he was glad to think that Ellinor&rsquo;s future was assured, and that
she would have a protector and friends after he was dead and gone.&nbsp;
But he did not want them to assume their responsibilities so soon.&nbsp;
He had not distinctly contemplated her marriage as an event likely to
happen before his death.&nbsp; He could not understand how his own life
would go on without her: or indeed why she and Ralph Corbet could not
continue just as they were at present.&nbsp; He came down to breakfast
with the letter in his hand.&nbsp; By Ellinor&rsquo;s blushes, as she
glanced at the handwriting, he knew that she had heard from her lover
by the same post; by her tender caresses&mdash;caresses given as if
to make up for the pain which the prospect of her leaving him was sure
to cause him&mdash;he was certain that she was aware of the contents
of the letter.&nbsp; Yet he put it in his pocket, and tried to forget
it.</p>
<p>He did this not merely from his reluctance to complete any arrangements
which might facilitate Ellinor&rsquo;s marriage.&nbsp; There was a further
annoyance connected with the affair.&nbsp; His money matters had been
for some time in an involved state; he had been living beyond his income,
even reckoning that, as he always did, at the highest point which it
ever touched.&nbsp; He kept no regular accounts, reasoning with himself&mdash;or,
perhaps, I should rather say persuading himself&mdash;that there was
no great occasion for regular accounts, when he had a steady income
arising from his profession, as well as the interest of a good sum of
money left him by his father; and when, living in his own house near
a country town where provisions were cheap, his expenditure for his
small family&mdash;only one child&mdash;could never amount to anything
like his incomings from the above-mentioned sources.&nbsp; But servants
and horses, and choice wines and rare fruit-trees, and a habit of purchasing
any book or engraving that may take the fancy, irrespective of the price,
run away with money, even though there be but one child.&nbsp; A year
or two ago, Mr. Wilkins had been startled into a system of exaggerated
retrenchment&mdash;retrenchment which only lasted about six weeks&mdash;by
the sudden bursting of a bubble speculation in which he had invested
a part of his father&rsquo;s savings.&nbsp; But as soon as the change
in his habits, necessitated by his new economies, became irksome, he
had comforted himself for his relapse into his former easy extravagance
of living by remembering the fact that Ellinor was engaged to the son
of a man of large property: and that though Ralph was only the second
son, yet his mother&rsquo;s estate must come to him, as Mr. Ness had
already mentioned, on first hearing of her engagement.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilkins did not doubt that he could easily make Ellinor a fitting
allowance, or even pay down a requisite dowry; but the doing so would
involve an examination into the real state of his affairs, and this
involved distasteful trouble.&nbsp; He had no idea how much more than
mere temporary annoyance would arise out of the investigation.&nbsp;
Until it was made, he decided in his own mind that he would not speak
to Ellinor on the subject of her lover&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; So for
the next few days she was kept in suspense, seeing little of her father;
and during the short times she was with him she was made aware that
he was nervously anxious to keep the conversation engaged on general
topics rather than on the one which she had at heart.&nbsp; As I have
already said, Mr. Corbet had written to her by the same post as that
on which he sent the letter to her father, telling her of its contents,
and begging her (in all those sweet words which lovers know how to use)
to urge her father to compliance for his sake&mdash;his, her lover&rsquo;s&mdash;who
was pining and lonely in all the crowds of London, since her loved presence
was not there.&nbsp; He did not care for money, save as a means of hastening
their marriage; indeed, if there were only some income fixed, however
small&mdash;some time for their marriage fixed, however distant&mdash;he
could be patient.&nbsp; He did not want superfluity of wealth; his habits
were simple, as she well knew; and money enough would be theirs in time,
both from her share of contingencies, and the certainty of his finally
possessing Bromley.</p>
<p>Ellinor delayed replying to this letter until her father should have
spoken to her on the subject.&nbsp; But as she perceived that he avoided
all such conversation, the young girl&rsquo;s heart failed her.&nbsp;
She began to blame herself for wishing to leave him, to reproach herself
for being accessory to any step which made him shun being alone with
her, and look distressed and full of care as he did now.&nbsp; It was
the usual struggle between father and lover for the possession of love,
instead of the natural and graceful resignation of the parent to the
prescribed course of things; and, as usual, it was the poor girl who
bore the suffering for no fault of her own: although she blamed herself
for being the cause of the disturbance in the previous order of affairs.&nbsp;
Ellinor had no one to speak to confidentially but her father and her
lover, and when they were at issue she could talk openly to neither,
so she brooded over Mr. Corbet&rsquo;s unanswered letter, and her father&rsquo;s
silence, and became pale and dispirited.&nbsp; Once or twice she looked
up suddenly, and caught her father&rsquo;s eye gazing upon her with
a certain wistful anxiety; but the instant she saw this he pulled himself
up, as it were, and would begin talking gaily about the small topics
of the day.</p>
<p>At length Mr. Corbet grew impatient at not hearing either from Mr.
Wilkins or Ellinor, and wrote urgently to the former, making known to
him a new proposal suggested to him by his father, which was, that a
certain sum should be paid down by Mr. Wilkins to be applied, under
the management of trustees, to the improvement of the Bromley estate,
out of the profits of which, or other sources in the elder Mr. Corbet&rsquo;s
hands, a heavy rate of interest should be paid on this advance, which
would secure an income to the young couple immediately, and considerably
increase the value of the estate upon which Ellinor&rsquo;s settlement
was to be made.&nbsp; The terms offered for this laying down of ready
money were so advantageous, that Mr. Wilkins was strongly tempted to
accede to them at once; as Ellinor&rsquo;s pale cheek and want of appetite
had only that very morning smote upon his conscience, and this immediate
transfer of ready money was as a sacrifice, a soothing balm to his self-reproach,
and laziness and dislike to immediate unpleasantness of action had its
counterbalancing weakness in imprudence.&nbsp; Mr. Wilkins made some
rough calculations on a piece of paper&mdash;deeds, and all such tests
of accuracy, being down at the office; discovered that he could pay
down the sum required; wrote a letter agreeing to the proposal, and
before he sealed it called Ellinor into his study, and bade her read
what he had been writing and tell him what she thought of it.&nbsp;
He watched the colour come rushing into her white face, her lips quiver
and tremble, and even before the letter was ended she was in his arms
kissing him, and thanking him with blushing caresses rather than words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there!&rdquo; said he, smiling and sighing; &ldquo;that
will do.&nbsp; Why, I do believe you took me for a hard-hearted father,
just like a heroine&rsquo;s father in a book.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve looked
as woe-begone this week past as Ophelia.&nbsp; One can&rsquo;t make
up one&rsquo;s mind in a day about such sums of money as this, little
woman; and you should have let your old father have time to consider.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, papa; I was only afraid you were angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I was a bit perplexed, seeing you look so ill and
pining was not the way to bring me round.&nbsp; Old Corbet, I must say,
is trying to make a good bargain for his son.&nbsp; It is well for me
that I have never been an extravagant man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, papa, we don&rsquo;t want all this much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes! it is all right.&nbsp; You shall go into their family
as a well-portioned girl, if you can&rsquo;t go as a Lady Maria.&nbsp;
Come, don&rsquo;t trouble your little head any more about it.&nbsp;
Give me one more kiss, and then we&rsquo;ll go and order the horses,
and have a ride together, by way of keeping holiday.&nbsp; I deserve
a holiday, don&rsquo;t I, Nelly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some country people at work at the roadside, as the father and daughter
passed along, stopped to admire their bright happy looks, and one spoke
of the hereditary handsomeness of the Wilkins family (for the old man,
the present Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s father, had been fine-looking in his
drab breeches and gaiters, and usual assumption of a yeoman&rsquo;s
dress).&nbsp; Another said it was easy for the rich to be handsome;
they had always plenty to eat, and could ride when they were tired of
walking, and had no care for the morrow to keep them from sleeping at
nights.&nbsp; And, in sad acquiescence with their contrasted lot, the
men went on with their hedging and ditching in silence.</p>
<p>And yet, if they had known&mdash;if the poor did know&mdash;the troubles
and temptations of the rich; if those men had foreseen the lot darkening
over the father, and including the daughter in its cloud; if Mr. Wilkins
himself had even imagined such a future possible . . . Well, there was
truth in the old heathen saying, &ldquo;Let no man be envied till his
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellinor had no more rides with her father; no, not ever again; though
they had stopped that afternoon at the summit of a breezy common, and
looked at a ruined hall, not so very far off; and discussed whether
they could reach it that day, and decided that it was too far away for
anything but a hurried inspection, and that some day soon they would
make the old place into the principal object of an excursion.&nbsp;
But a rainy time came on, when no rides were possible; and whether it
was the influence of the weather, or some other care or trouble that
oppressed him, Mr. Wilkins seemed to lose all wish for much active exercise,
and rather sought a stimulus to his spirits and circulation in wine.&nbsp;
But of this Ellinor was innocently unaware.&nbsp; He seemed dull and
weary, and sat long, drowsing and drinking after dinner.&nbsp; If the
servants had not been so fond of him for much previous generosity and
kindness, they would have complained now, and with reason, of his irritability,
for all sorts of things seemed to annoy him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should get the master to take a ride with you, miss,&rdquo;
said Dixon, one day as he was putting Ellinor on her horse.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
not looking well, he&rsquo;s studying too much at the office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when Ellinor named it to her father, he rather hastily replied
that it was all very well for women to ride out whenever they liked&mdash;men
had something else to do; and then, as he saw her look grave and puzzled,
he softened down his abrupt saying by adding that Dunster had been making
a fuss about his partner&rsquo;s non-attendance, and altogether taking
a good deal upon himself in a very offensive way, so that he thought
it better to go pretty regularly to the office, in order to show him
who was master&mdash;senior partner, and head of the business, at any
rate.</p>
<p>Ellinor sighed a little over her disappointment at her father&rsquo;s
preoccupation, and then forgot her own little regret in anger at Mr.
Dunster, who had seemed all along to be a thorn in her father&rsquo;s
side, and had latterly gained some power and authority over him, the
exercise of which, Ellinor could not help thinking, was a very impertinent
line of conduct from a junior partner, so lately only a paid clerk,
to his superior.&nbsp; There was a sense of something wrong in the Ford
Bank household for many weeks about this time.&nbsp; Mr. Wilkins was
not like himself, and his cheerful ways and careless genial speeches
were missed, even on the days when he was not irritable, and evidently
uneasy with himself and all about him.&nbsp; The spring was late in
coming, and cold rain and sleet made any kind of out-door exercise a
trouble and discomfort rather than a bright natural event in the course
of the day.&nbsp; All sound of winter gaieties, of assemblies and meets,
and jovial dinners, had died away, and the summer pleasures were as
yet unthought of.&nbsp; Still Ellinor had a secret perennial source
of sunshine in her heart; whenever she thought of Ralph she could not
feel much oppression from the present unspoken and indistinct gloom.&nbsp;
He loved her; and oh, how she loved him! and perhaps this very next
autumn&mdash;but that depended on his own success in his profession.&nbsp;
After all, if it was not this autumn it would be the next; and with
the letters that she received weekly, and the occasional visits that
her lover ran down to Hamley to pay Mr. Ness, Ellinor felt as if she
would almost prefer the delay of the time when she must leave her father&rsquo;s
for a husband&rsquo;s roof.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p>At Easter&mdash;just when the heavens and earth were looking their
dreariest, for Easter fell very early this year&mdash;Mr. Corbet came
down.&nbsp; Mr. Wilkins was too busy to see much of him; they were together
even less than usual, although not less friendly when they did meet.&nbsp;
But to Ellinor the visit was one of unmixed happiness.&nbsp; Hitherto
she had always had a little fear mingled up with her love of Mr. Corbet;
but his manners were softened, his opinions less decided and abrupt,
and his whole treatment of her showed such tenderness, that the young
girl basked and revelled in it.&nbsp; One or two of their conversations
had reference to their future married life in London; and she then perceived,
although it did not jar against her, that her lover had not forgotten
his ambition in his love.&nbsp; He tried to inoculate her with something
of his own craving for success in life; but it was all in vain: she
nestled to him, and told him she did not care to be the Lord Chancellor&rsquo;s
wife&mdash;wigs and wool-sacks were not in her line; only if he wished
it, she would wish it.</p>
<p>The last two days of his stay the weather changed.&nbsp; Sudden heat
burst forth, as it does occasionally for a few hours even in our chilly
English spring.&nbsp; The grey-brown bushes and trees started almost
with visible progress into the tender green shade which is the forerunner
of the bursting leaves.&nbsp; The sky was of full cloudless blue.&nbsp;
Mr. Wilkins was to come home pretty early from the office to ride out
with his daughter and her lover; but, after waiting some time for him,
it grew too late, and they were obliged to give up the project.&nbsp;
Nothing would serve Ellinor, then, but that she must carry out a table
and have tea in the garden, on the sunny side of the tree, among the
roots of which she used to play when a child.&nbsp; Miss Monro objected
a little to this caprice of Ellinor&rsquo;s, saying that it was too
early for out-of-door meals; but Mr. Corbet overruled all objections,
and helped her in her gay preparations.&nbsp; She always kept to the
early hours of her childhood, although she, as then, regularly sat with
her father at his late dinner; and this meal <i>al fresco</i> was to
be a reality to her and Miss Monro.&nbsp; There was a place arranged
for her father, and she seized upon him as he was coming from the stable-yard,
by the shrubbery path, to his study, and with merry playfulness made
him a prisoner, accusing him of disappointing them of their ride, and
drawing him more than half unwilling, to his chair by the table.&nbsp;
But he was silent, and almost sad: his presence damped them all; they
could hardly tell why, for he did not object to anything, though he
seemed to enjoy nothing, and only to force a smile at Ellinor&rsquo;s
occasional sallies.&nbsp; These became more and more rare as she perceived
her father&rsquo;s depression.&nbsp; She watched him anxiously.&nbsp;
He perceived it, and said&mdash;shivering in that strange unaccountable
manner which is popularly explained by the expression that some one
is passing over the earth that will one day form your grave&mdash;&ldquo;Ellinor!
this is not a day for out-of-door tea.&nbsp; I never felt so chilly
a spot in my life.&nbsp; I cannot keep from shaking where I sit.&nbsp;
I must leave this place, my dear, in spite of all your good tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, papa!&nbsp; I am so sorry.&nbsp; But look how full that
hot sun&rsquo;s rays come on this turf.&nbsp; I thought I had chosen
such a capital spot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he got up and persisted in leaving the table, although he was
evidently sorry to spoil the little party.&nbsp; He walked up and down
the gravel walk, close by them, talking to them as he kept passing by
and trying to cheer them up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you warmer now, papa?&rdquo; asked Ellinor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only that place
that seems so chilly and damp.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m as warm as a toast now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning Mr. Corbet left them.&nbsp; The unseasonably fine
weather passed away too, and all things went back to their rather grey
and dreary aspect; but Ellinor was too happy to feel this much, knowing
what absent love existed for her alone, and from this knowledge unconsciously
trusting in the sun behind the clouds.</p>
<p>I have said that few or none in the immediate neighbourhood of Hamley,
beside their own household and Mr. Ness, knew of Ellinor&rsquo;s engagement.&nbsp;
At one of the rare dinner-parties to which she accompanied her father&mdash;it
was at the old lady&rsquo;s house who chaperoned her to the assemblies&mdash;she
was taken in to dinner by a young clergyman staying in the neighbourhood.&nbsp;
He had just had a small living given to him in his own county, and he
felt as if this was a great step in his life.&nbsp; He was good, innocent,
and rather boyish in appearance.&nbsp; Ellinor was happy and at her
ease, and chatted away to this Mr. Livingstone on many little points
of interest which they found they had in common: church music, and the
difficulty they had in getting people to sing in parts; Salisbury Cathedral,
which they had both seen; styles of church architecture, Ruskin&rsquo;s
works, and parish schools, in which Mr. Livingstone was somewhat shocked
to find that Ellinor took no great interest.&nbsp; When the gentleman
came in from the dining-room, it struck Ellinor, for the first time
in her life, that her father had taken more wine than was good for him.&nbsp;
Indeed, this had rather become a habit with him of late; but as he always
tried to go quietly off to his own room when such had been the case,
his daughter had never been aware of it before, and the perception of
it now made her cheeks hot with shame.&nbsp; She thought that everyone
must be as conscious of his altered manner and way of speaking as she
was, and after a pause of sick silence, during which she could not say
a word, she set to and talked to Mr. Livingstone about parish schools,
anything, with redoubled vigour and apparent interest, in order to keep
one or two of the company, at least, from noticing what was to her so
painfully obvious.</p>
<p>The effect of her behaviour was far more than she had intended.&nbsp;
She kept Mr. Livingstone, it is true, from observing her father, but
she also riveted his attention on herself.&nbsp; He had thought her
very pretty and agreeable during dinner: but after dinner he considered
her bewitching, irresistible.&nbsp; He dreamed of her all night, and
wakened up the next morning to a calculation of how far his income would
allow him to furnish his pretty new parsonage with that crowning blessing,
a wife.&nbsp; For a day or two he did up little sums, and sighed, and
thought of Ellinor, her face listening with admiring interest to his
sermons, her arm passed into his as they went together round the parish;
her sweet voice instructing classes in his schools&mdash;turn where
he would, in his imagination Ellinor&rsquo;s presence rose up before
him.</p>
<p>The consequence was that he wrote an offer, which he found a far
more perplexing piece of composition than a sermon; a real hearty expression
of love, going on, over all obstacles, to a straightforward explanation
of his present prospects and future hopes, and winding up with the information
that on the succeeding morning he would call to know whether he might
speak to Mr. Wilkins on the subject of this letter.&nbsp; It was given
to Ellinor in the evening, as she was sitting with Miss Monro in the
library.&nbsp; Mr. Wilkins was dining out, she hardly knew where, as
it was a sudden engagement, of which he had sent word from the office&mdash;a
gentleman&rsquo;s dinner-party, she supposed, as he had dressed in Hamley
without coming home.&nbsp; Ellinor turned over the letter when it was
brought to her, as some people do when they cannot recognise the handwriting,
as if to discover from paper or seal what two moments would assure them
of, if they opened the letter and looked at the signature.&nbsp; Ellinor
could not guess who had written it by any outward sign; but the moment
she saw the name &ldquo;Herbert Livingstone,&rdquo; the meaning of the
letter flashed upon her and she coloured all over.&nbsp; She put the
letter away, unread, for a few minutes, and then made some excuse for
leaving the room and going upstairs.&nbsp; When safe in her bed-chamber,
she read the young man&rsquo;s eager words with a sense of self-reproach.&nbsp;
How must she, engaged to one man, have been behaving to another, if
this was the result of a single evening&rsquo;s interview?&nbsp; The
self-reproach was unjustly bestowed; but with that we have nothing to
do.&nbsp; She made herself very miserable; and at last went down with
a heavy heart to go on with Dante, and rummage up words in the dictionary.&nbsp;
All the time she seemed to Miss Monro to be plodding on with her Italian
more diligently and sedately than usual, she was planning in her own
mind to speak to her father as soon as he returned (and he had said
that he should not be late), and beg him to undo the mischief she had
done by seeing Mr. Livingstone the next morning, and frankly explaining
the real state of affairs to him.&nbsp; But she wanted to read her letter
again, and think it all over in peace; and so, at an early hour, she
wished Miss Monro good-night, and went up into her own room above the
drawing-room, and overlooking the flower-garden and shrubbery-path to
the stable-yard, by which her father was sure to return.&nbsp; She went
upstairs and studied her letter well, and tried to recall all her speeches
and conduct on that miserable evening&mdash;as she thought it then&mdash;not
knowing what true misery was.&nbsp; Her head ached, and she put out
the candle, and went and sat on the window-seat, looking out into the
moonlit garden, watching for her father.&nbsp; She opened the window;
partly to cool her forehead, partly to enable her to call down softly
when she should see him coming along.&nbsp; By-and-by the door from
the stable-yard into the shrubbery clicked and opened, and in a moment
she saw Mr. Wilkins moving through the bushes; but not alone, Mr. Dunster
was with him, and the two were talking together in rather excited tones,
immediately lost to hearing, however, as they entered Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s
study by the outer door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have been dining together somewhere.&nbsp; Probably at
Mr. Hanbury&rsquo;s&rdquo; (the Hamley brewer), thought Ellinor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But how provoking that he should have come home with papa this
night of all nights!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two or three times before Mr. Dunster had called on Mr. Wilkins in
the evening, as Ellinor knew; but she was not quite aware of the reason
for such late visits, and had never put together the two facts&mdash;(as
cause and consequence)&mdash;that on such occasions her father had been
absent from the office all day, and that there might be necessary business
for him to transact, the urgency of which was the motive for Mr. Dunster&rsquo;s
visits.&nbsp; Mr. Wilkins always seemed to be annoyed by his coming
at so late an hour, and spoke of it, resenting the intrusion upon his
leisure; and Ellinor, without consideration, adopted her father&rsquo;s
mode of speaking and thinking on the subject, and was rather more angry
than he was whenever the obnoxious partner came on business in the evening.&nbsp;
This night was, of all nights, the most ill-purposed time (so Ellinor
thought) for a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with her father!&nbsp;
However, there was no doubt in her mind as to what she had to do.&nbsp;
So late as it was, the unwelcome visitor could not stop long; and then
she would go down and have her little confidence with her father, and
beg him to see Mr. Livingstone when he came next morning, and dismiss
him as gently as might be.</p>
<p>She sat on in the window-seat; dreaming waking dreams of future happiness.&nbsp;
She kept losing herself in such thoughts, and became almost afraid of
forgetting why she sat there.&nbsp; Presently she felt cold, and got
up to fetch a shawl, in which she muffled herself and resumed her place.&nbsp;
It seemed to her growing very late; the moonlight was coming fuller
and fuller into the garden and the blackness of the shadow was more
concentrated and stronger.&nbsp; Surely Mr. Dunster could not have gone
away along the dark shrubbery-path so noiselessly but what she must
have heard him?&nbsp; No! there was the swell of voices coming up through
the window from her father&rsquo;s study: angry voices they were; and
her anger rose sympathetically, as she knew that her father was being
irritated.&nbsp; There was a sudden movement, as of chairs pushed hastily
aside, and then a mysterious unaccountable noise&mdash;heavy, sudden;
and then a slight movement as of chairs again; and then a profound stillness.&nbsp;
Ellinor leaned her head against the side of the window to listen more
intently, for some mysterious instinct made her sick and faint.&nbsp;
No sound&mdash;no noise.&nbsp; Only by-and-by she heard, what we have
all heard at such times of intent listening, the beating of the pulses
of her heart, and then the whirling rush of blood through her head.&nbsp;
How long did this last?&nbsp; She never knew.&nbsp; By-and-by she heard
her father&rsquo;s hurried footstep in his bedroom, next to hers; but
when she ran thither to speak to him, and ask him what was amiss&mdash;if
anything had been&mdash;if she might come to him now about Mr. Livingstone&rsquo;s
letter, she found that he had gone down again to his study, and almost
at the same moment she heard the little private outer door of that room
open; some one went out, and then there were hurried footsteps along
the shrubbery-path.&nbsp; She thought, of course, that it was Mr. Dunster
leaving the house; and went back for Mr. Livingstone&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp;
Having found it, she passed through her father&rsquo;s room to the private
staircase, thinking that if she went by the more regular way, she would
have run the risk of disturbing Miss Monro, and perhaps of being questioned
in the morning.&nbsp; Even in passing down this remote staircase, she
trod softly for fear of being overheard.&nbsp; When she entered the
room, the full light of the candles dazzled her for an instant, coming
out of the darkness.&nbsp; They were flaring wildly in the draught that
came in through the open door, by which the outer air was admitted;
for a moment there seemed no one in the room, and then she saw, with
strange sick horror, the legs of some one lying on the carpet behind
the table.&nbsp; As if compelled, even while she shrank from doing it,
she went round to see who it was that lay there, so still and motionless
as never to stir at her sudden coming.&nbsp; It was Mr. Dunster; his
head propped on chair-cushions, his eyes open, staring, distended.&nbsp;
There was a strong smell of brandy and hartshorn in the room; a smell
so powerful as not to be neutralized by the free current of night air
that blew through the two open doors.&nbsp; Ellinor could not have told
whether it was reason or instinct that made her act as she did during
this awful night.&nbsp; In thinking of it afterwards, with shuddering
avoidance of the haunting memory that would come and overshadow her
during many, many years of her life, she grew to believe that the powerful
smell of the spilt brandy absolutely intoxicated her&mdash;an unconscious
Rechabite in practice.&nbsp; But something gave her a presence of mind
and a courage not her own.&nbsp; And though she learnt to think afterwards
that she had acted unwisely, if not wrongly and wickedly, yet she marvelled,
in recalling that time, how she could have then behaved as she did.&nbsp;
First of all she lifted herself up from her fascinated gaze at the dead
man, and went to the staircase door, by which she had entered the study,
and shut it softly.&nbsp; Then she went back&mdash;looked again; took
the brandy-bottle, and knelt down, and tried to pour some into the mouth;
but this she found she could not do.&nbsp; Then she wetted her handkerchief
with the spirit, and moistened the lips; all to no purpose; for, as
I have said before, the man was dead&mdash;killed by rupture of a vessel
of the brain; how occasioned I must tell by-and-by.&nbsp; Of course,
all Ellinor&rsquo;s little cares and efforts produced no effect; her
father had tried them before&mdash;vain endeavours all, to bring back
the precious breath of life!&nbsp; The poor girl could not bear the
look of those open eyes, and softly, tenderly, tried to close them,
although unconscious that in so doing she was rendering the pious offices
of some beloved hand to a dead man.&nbsp; She was sitting by the body
on the floor when she heard steps coming with rushing and yet cautious
tread, through the shrubbery; she had no fear, although it might be
the tread of robbers and murderers.&nbsp; The awfulness of the hour
raised her above common fears; though she did not go through the usual
process of reasoning, and by it feel assured that the feet which were
coming so softly and swiftly along were the same which she had heard
leaving the room in like manner only a quarter of an hour before.</p>
<p>Her father entered, and started back, almost upsetting some one behind
him by his recoil, on seeing his daughter in her motionless attitude
by the dead man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, Ellinor! what has brought you here?&rdquo; he said,
almost fiercely.</p>
<p>But she answered as one stupefied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;
Is he dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush, child; it cannot be helped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She raised her eyes to the solemn, pitying, awe-stricken face behind
her father&rsquo;s&mdash;the countenance of Dixon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; she asked of him.</p>
<p>The man stepped forwards, respectfully pushing his master on one
side as he did so.&nbsp; He bent down over the corpse, and looked, and
listened and then reaching a candle off the table, he signed Mr. Wilkins
to close the door.&nbsp; And Mr. Wilkins obeyed, and looked with an
intensity of eagerness almost amounting to faintness on the experiment,
and yet he could not hope.&nbsp; The flame was steady&mdash;steady and
pitilessly unstirred, even when it was adjusted close to mouth and nostril;
the head was raised up by one of Dixon&rsquo;s stalwart arms, while
he held the candle in the other hand.&nbsp; Ellinor fancied that there
was some trembling on Dixon&rsquo;s part, and grasped his wrist tightly
in order to give it the requisite motionless firmness.</p>
<p>All in vain.&nbsp; The head was placed again on the cushions, the
servant rose and stood by his master, looked sadly on the dead man,
whom, living, none of them had liked or cared for, and Ellinor sat on,
quiet and tearless, as one in a trance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was it, father?&rdquo; at length she asked.</p>
<p>He would fain have had her ignorant of all, but so questioned by
her lips, so adjured by her eyes in the very presence of death, he could
not choose but speak the truth; he spoke it in convulsive gasps, each
sentence an effort:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He taunted me&mdash;he was insolent, beyond my patience&mdash;I
could not bear it.&nbsp; I struck him&mdash;I can&rsquo;t tell how it
was.&nbsp; He must have hit his head in falling.&nbsp; Oh, my God! one
little hour a go I was innocent of this man&rsquo;s blood!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He covered his face with his hands.</p>
<p>Ellinor took the candle again; kneeling behind Mr. Dunster&rsquo;s
head, she tried the futile experiment once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could not a doctor do some good?&rdquo; she asked of Dixon,
in a hopeless voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said he, shaking his head, and looking with a sidelong
glance at his master, who seemed to shrivel up and to shrink away at
the bare suggestion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Doctors can do nought, I&rsquo;m afeard.&nbsp;
All that a doctor could do, I take it, would be to open a vein, and
that I could do along with the best of them, if I had but my fleam here.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He fumbled in his pockets as he spoke, and, as chance would it, the
&ldquo;fleam&rdquo; (or cattle lancet) was somewhere about his dress.&nbsp;
He drew it out, smoothed and tried it on his finger.&nbsp; Ellinor tried
to bare the arm, but turned sick as she did so.&nbsp; Her father started
eagerly forwards, and did what was necessary with hurried trembling
hands.&nbsp; If they had cared less about the result, they might have
been more afraid of the consequences of the operation in the hands of
one so ignorant as Dixon.&nbsp; But, vein or artery, it signified little;
no living blood gushed out; only a little watery moisture followed the
cut of the fleam.&nbsp; They laid him back on his strange sad death-couch.&nbsp;
Dixon spoke next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Ned!&rdquo; said he&mdash;for he had known Mr. Wilkins
in his days of bright careless boyhood, and almost was carried back
to them by the sense of charge and protection which the servant&rsquo;s
presence of mind and sharpened senses gave him over his master on this
dreary night&mdash;&ldquo;Master Ned! we must do summut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one spoke.&nbsp; What was to be done?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did any folk see him come here?&rdquo; Dixon asked, after
a time.&nbsp; Ellinor looked up to hear her father&rsquo;s answer, a
wild hope coming into her mind that all might be concealed somehow;
she did not know how, nor did she think of any consequences except saving
her father from the vague dread, trouble, and punishment that she was
aware would await him if all were known.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilkins did not seem to hear; in fact, he did not hear anything
but the unspoken echo of his own last words, that went booming through
his heart: &ldquo;An hour ago I was innocent of this man&rsquo;s blood!&nbsp;
Only an hour ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dixon got up and poured out half a tumblerful of raw spirit from
the brandy-bottle that stood on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink this, Master Ned!&rdquo; putting it to his master&rsquo;s
lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay&rdquo;&mdash;to Ellinor&mdash;&ldquo;it will
do him no harm; only bring back his senses, which, poor gentleman, are
scared away.&nbsp; We shall need all our wits.&nbsp; Now, sir, please
answer my question.&nbsp; Did anyone see Measter Dunster come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilkins, recovering his
speech.&nbsp; &ldquo;It all seems in a mist.&nbsp; He offered to walk
home with me; I did not want him.&nbsp; I was almost rude to him to
keep him off.&nbsp; I did not want to talk of business; I had taken
too much wine to be very clear and some things at the office were not
quite in order, and he had found it out.&nbsp; If anyone heard our conversation,
they must know I did not want him to come with me.&nbsp; Oh! why would
he come?&nbsp; He was as obstinate&mdash;he would come&mdash;and here
it has been his death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, what&rsquo;s done can&rsquo;t be undone, and I&rsquo;m
sure we&rsquo;d any of us bring him back to life if we could, even by
cutting off our hands, though he was a mighty plaguey chap while he&rsquo;d
breath in him.&nbsp; But what I&rsquo;m thinking is this: it&rsquo;ll
maybe go awkward with you, sir, if he&rsquo;s found here.&nbsp; One
can&rsquo;t say.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t you think, miss, as he&rsquo;s
neither kith nor kin to miss him, we might just bury him away before
morning, somewhere?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s better nor four hours of dark.&nbsp;
I wish we could put him i&rsquo; the churchyard, but that can&rsquo;t
be; but, to my mind, the sooner we set about digging a place for him
to lie in, poor fellow, the better it&rsquo;ll be for us all in the
end.&nbsp; I can pare a piece of turf up where it&rsquo;ll never be
missed, and if master&rsquo;ll take one spade, and I another, why we&rsquo;ll
lay him softly down, and cover him up, and no one&rsquo;ll be the wiser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no reply from either for a minute or so.&nbsp; Then Mr.
Wilkins said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my father could have known of my living to this!&nbsp;
Why, they will try me as a criminal; and you, Ellinor?&nbsp; Dixon,
you are right.&nbsp; We must conceal it, or I must cut my throat, for
I never could live through it.&nbsp; One minute of passion, and my life
blasted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, sir,&rdquo; said Dixon; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no
time to lose.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they went out in search of tools; Ellinor
following them, shivering all over, but begging that she might be with
them, and not have to remain in the study with&mdash;</p>
<p>She would not be bidden into her own room; she dreaded inaction and
solitude.&nbsp; She made herself busy with carrying heavy baskets of
turf, and straining her strength to the utmost; fetching all that was
wanted, with soft swift steps.</p>
<p>Once, as she passed near the open study door, she thought that she
heard a rustling, and a flash of hope came across her.&nbsp; Could he
be reviving?&nbsp; She entered, but a moment was enough to undeceive
her; it had only been a night rustle among the trees.&nbsp; Of hope,
life, there was none.</p>
<p>They dug the hole deep and well; working with fierce energy to quench
thought and remorse.&nbsp; Once or twice her father asked for brandy,
which Ellinor, reassured by the apparently good effect of the first
dose, brought to him without a word; and once at her father&rsquo;s
suggestion she brought food, such as she could find in the dining-room
without disturbing the household, for Dixon.</p>
<p>When all was ready for the reception of the body in its unblessed
grave, Mr. Wilkins bade Ellinor go up to her own room&mdash;she had
done all she could to help them; the rest must be done by them alone.&nbsp;
She felt that it must; and indeed both her nerves and her bodily strength
were giving way.&nbsp; She would have kissed her father, as he sat wearily
at the head of the grave&mdash;Dixon had gone in to make some arrangement
for carrying the corpse&mdash;but he pushed her away quietly, but resolutely&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Nelly, you must never kiss me again; I am a murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I will, my own darling papa,&rdquo; said she, throwing
her arms passionately round his neck, and covering his face with kisses.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I love you, and I don&rsquo;t care what you are, if you were
twenty times a murderer, which you are not; I am sure it was only an
accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go in, my child, go in, and try to get some rest.&nbsp; But
go in, for we must finish as fast as we can.&nbsp; The moon is down;
it will soon be daylight.&nbsp; What a blessing there are no rooms on
one side of the house.&nbsp; Go, Nelly.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she went; straining
herself up to move noiselessly, with eyes averted, through the room
which she shuddered at as the place of hasty and unhallowed death.</p>
<p>Once in her own room she bolted the door on the inside, and then
stole to the window, as if some fascination impelled her to watch all
the proceedings to the end.&nbsp; But her aching eyes could hardly penetrate
through the thick darkness, which, at the time of the year of which
I am speaking, so closely precedes the dawn.&nbsp; She could discern
the tops of the trees against the sky, and could single out the well-known
one, at a little distance from the stem of which the grave was made,
in the very piece of turf over which so lately she and Ralph had had
their merry little tea-making; and where her father, as she now remembered,
had shuddered and shivered, as if the ground on which his seat had then
been placed was fateful and ominous to him.</p>
<p>Those below moved softly and quietly in all they did; but every sound
had a significant and terrible interpretation to Ellinor&rsquo;s ears.&nbsp;
Before they had ended, the little birds had begun to pipe out their
gay <i>reveill&eacute;e</i> to the dawn.&nbsp; Then doors closed, and
all was profoundly still.</p>
<p>Ellinor threw herself, in her clothes, on the bed; and was thankful
for the intense weary physical pain which took off something of the
anguish of thought&mdash;anguish that she fancied from time to time
was leading to insanity.</p>
<p>By-and-by the morning cold made her instinctively creep between the
blankets; and, once there, she fell into a dead heavy sleep.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p>Ellinor was awakened by a rapping at her door: it was her maid.</p>
<p>She was fully aroused in a moment, for she had fallen asleep with
one clearly defined plan in her mind, only one, for all thoughts and
cares having no relation to the terrible event were as though they had
never been.&nbsp; All her purpose was to shield her father from suspicion.&nbsp;
And to do this she must control herself&mdash;heart, mind, and body
must be ruled to this one end.</p>
<p>So she said to Mason:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me lie half an hour longer; and beg Miss Monro not to
wait breakfast for me; but in half an hour bring me up a cup of strong
tea, for I have a bad headache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mason went away.&nbsp; Ellinor sprang up; rapidly undressed herself,
and got into bed again, so that when her maid returned with her breakfast,
there was no appearance of the night having been passed in any unusual
manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How ill you do look, miss!&rdquo; said Mason.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am sure you had better not get up yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellinor longed to ask if her father had yet shown himself; but this
question&mdash;so natural at any other time&mdash;seemed to her so suspicious
under the circumstances, that she could not bring her lips to frame
it.&nbsp; At any rate, she must get up and struggle to make the day
like all other days.&nbsp; So she rose, confessing that she did not
feel very well, but trying to make light of it, and when she could think
of anything but the one awe, to say a trivial sentence or two.&nbsp;
But she could not recollect how she behaved in general, for her life
hitherto had been simple, and led without any consciousness of effect.</p>
<p>Before she was dressed, a message came up to say that Mr. Livingstone
was in the drawing-room.</p>
<p>Mr. Livingstone!&nbsp; He belonged to the old life of yesterday!&nbsp;
The billows of the night had swept over his mark on the sands of her
memory; and it was only by a strong effort that she could remember who
he was&mdash;what he wanted.&nbsp; She sent Mason down to inquire from
the servant who admitted him whom it was that he had asked for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He asked for master first.&nbsp; But master has not rung for
his water yet, so James told him he was not up.&nbsp; Then he took thought
for a while, and asked could he speak to you, he would wait if you were
not at liberty but that he wished particular to see either master, or
you.&nbsp; So James asked him to sit down in the drawing-room, and he
would let you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; thought Ellinor.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will send
him away directly; to come, thinking of marriage to a house like this&mdash;to-day,
too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she went down hastily, and in a hard unsparing mood towards a
man, whose affection for her she thought was like a gourd, grown up
in a night, and of no account, but as a piece of foolish, boyish excitement.</p>
<p>She never thought of her own appearance&mdash;she had dressed without
looking in the glass.&nbsp; Her only object was to dismiss her would-be
suitor as speedily as possible.&nbsp; All feelings of shyness, awkwardness,
or maiden modesty, were quenched and overcome.&nbsp; In she went.</p>
<p>He was standing by the mantelpiece as she entered.&nbsp; He made
a step or two forward to meet her; and then stopped, petrified, as it
were, at the sight of her hard white face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Wilkins, I am afraid you are ill!&nbsp; I have come too
early.&nbsp; But I have to leave Hamley in half an hour, and I thought&mdash;Oh,
Miss Wilkins! what have I done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For she sank into the chair nearest to her, as if overcome by his
words; but, indeed, it was by the oppression of her own thoughts: she
was hardly conscious of his presence.</p>
<p>He came a step or two nearer, as if he longed to take her in his
arms and comfort and shelter her; but she stiffened herself and arose,
and by an effort walked towards the fireplace, and there stood, as if
awaiting what he would say next.&nbsp; But he was overwhelmed by her
aspect of illness.&nbsp; He almost forgot his own wishes, his own suit,
in his desire to relieve her from the pain, physical as he believed
it, under which she was suffering.&nbsp; It was she who had to begin
the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I received your letter yesterday, Mr. Livingstone.&nbsp; I
was anxious to see you to-day, in order that I might prevent you from
speaking to my father.&nbsp; I do not say anything of the kind of affection
you can feel for me&mdash;me, whom you have only seen once.&nbsp; All
I shall say is, that the sooner we both forget what I must call folly,
the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took the airs of a woman considerably older and more experienced
than himself.&nbsp; He thought her haughty; she was only miserable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; said he, more quietly and with more
dignity than was likely from his previous conduct.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
not allow you to characterise as folly what might be presumptuous on
my part&mdash;I had no business to express myself so soon&mdash;but
which in its foundation was true and sincere.&nbsp; That I can answer
for most solemnly.&nbsp; It is possible, though it may not be a usual
thing, for a man to feel so strongly attracted by the charms and qualities
of a woman, even at first sight, as to feel sure that she, and she alone,
can make his happiness.&nbsp; My folly consisted&mdash;there you are
right&mdash;in even dreaming that you could return my feelings in the
slightest degree, when you had only seen me once: and I am most truly
ashamed of myself.&nbsp; I cannot tell you how sorry I am, when I see
how you have compelled yourself to come and speak to me when you are
so ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She staggered into a chair, for with all her wish for his speedy
dismissal, she was obliged to be seated.&nbsp; His hand was upon the
bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wait a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes, bent upon her with a look of deep anxiety, touched her
at that moment, and she was on the point of shedding tears; but she
checked herself, and rose again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the kindest
thing I can do.&nbsp; Only, may I write?&nbsp; May I venture to write
and urge what I have to say more coherently?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t write.&nbsp;
I have given you my answer.&nbsp; We are nothing, and can be nothing
to each other.&nbsp; I am engaged to be married.&nbsp; I should not
have told you if you had not been so kind.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; But
go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor young man&rsquo;s face fell, and he became almost as white
as she was for the instant.&nbsp; After a moment&rsquo;s reflection,
he took her hand in his, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;May God bless you, and him too, whoever he be!&nbsp; But if
you want a friend, I may be that friend, may I not? and try to prove
that my words of regard were true, in a better and higher sense than
I used them at first.&rdquo;&nbsp; And kissing her passive hand, he
was gone and she was left sitting alone.</p>
<p>But solitude was not what she could bear.&nbsp; She went quickly
upstairs, and took a strong dose of sal-volatile, even while she heard
Miss Monro calling to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, who was that gentleman that has been closeted with
you in the drawing-room all this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, without listening to Ellinor&rsquo;s reply, she went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Jackson has been here&rdquo; (it was at Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s
house that Mr. Dunster lodged), &ldquo;wanting to know if we could tell
her where Mr. Dunster was, for he never came home last night at all.&nbsp;
And you were in the drawing-room with&mdash;who did you say he was?&mdash;that
Mr. Livingstone, who might have come at a better time to bid good-bye;
and he had never dined here, had he? so I don&rsquo;t see any reason
he had to come calling, and P. P. C.-ing, and your papa <i>not</i> up.&nbsp;
So I said to Mrs. Jackson, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll send and ask Mr. Wilkins,
if you like, but I don&rsquo;t see any use in it, for I can tell you
just as well as anybody, that Mr. Dunster is not in this house, wherever
he may be.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet nothing would satisfy her but that some
one must go and waken up your papa, and ask if he could tell where Mr.
Dunster was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did papa?&rdquo; inquired Ellinor, her dry throat huskily
forming the inquiry that seemed to be expected from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! to be sure not.&nbsp; How should Mr. Wilkins know?&nbsp;
As I said to Mrs. Jackson, &lsquo;Mr. Wilkins is not likely to know
where Mr. Dunster spends his time when he is not in the office, for
they do not move in the same rank of life, my good woman; and Mrs. Jackson
apologised, but said that yesterday they had both been dining at Mr.
Hodgson&rsquo;s together, she believed; and somehow she had got it into
her head that Mr. Dunster might have missed his way in coming along
Moor Lane, and might have slipped into the canal; so she just thought
she would step up and ask Mr. Wilkins if they had left Mr. Hodgson&rsquo;s
together, or if your papa had driven home.&nbsp; I asked her why she
had not told me all these particulars before, for I could have asked
your papa myself all about when he last saw Mr. Dunster; and I went
up to ask him a second time, but he did not like it at all, for he was
busy dressing, and I had to shout my questions through the door, and
he could not always hear me at first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he had walked part of the way with Mr. Dunster, and then
cut across by the short path through the fields, as far as I could understand
him through the door.&nbsp; He seemed very much annoyed to hear that
Mr. Dunster had not been at home all night; but he said I was to tell
Mrs. Jackson that he would go to the office as soon as he had had his
breakfast, which he ordered to be sent up directly into his own room,
and he had no doubt it would all turn out right, but that she had better
go home at once.&nbsp; And, as I told her, she might find Mr. Dunster
there by the time she got there.&nbsp; There, there is your papa going
out!&nbsp; He has not lost any time over his breakfast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellinor had taken up the <i>Hamley Examiner</i>, a daily paper, which
lay on the table, to hide her face in the first instance; but it served
a second purpose, as she glanced languidly over the columns of the advertisements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! here are Colonel Macdonald&rsquo;s orchideous plants to
be sold.&nbsp; All the stock of hothouse and stove plants at Hartwell
Priory.&nbsp; I must send James over to Hartwell to attend the sale.&nbsp;
It is to last for three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can he be spared for so long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; he had better stay at the little inn there, to be
on the spot.&nbsp; Three days,&rdquo; and as she spoke, she ran out
to the gardener, who was sweeping up the newly-mown grass in the front
of the house.&nbsp; She gave him hasty and unlimited directions, only
seeming intent&mdash;if any one had been suspiciously watching her words
and actions&mdash;to hurry him off to the distant village, where the
auction was to take place.</p>
<p>When he was once gone she breathed more freely.&nbsp; Now, no one
but the three cognisant of the terrible reason of the disturbance of
the turf under the trees in a certain spot in the belt round the flower-garden,
would be likely to go into the place.&nbsp; Miss Monro might wander
round with a book in her hand; but she never noticed anything, and was
short-sighted into the bargain.&nbsp; Three days of this moist, warm,
growing weather, and the green grass would spring, just as if life&mdash;was
what it had been twenty-four hours before.</p>
<p>When all this was done and said, it seemed as if Ellinor&rsquo;s
strength and spirit sank down at once.&nbsp; Her voice became feeble,
her aspect wan; and although she told Miss Monro that nothing was the
matter, yet it was impossible for any one who loved her not to perceive
that she was far from well.&nbsp; The kind governess placed her pupil
on the sofa, covered her feet up warmly, darkened the room, and then
stole out on tiptoe, fancying that Ellinor would sleep.&nbsp; Her eyes
were, indeed, shut; but try as much as she would to be quiet, she was
up in less than five minutes after Miss Monro had left the room, and
walking up and down in all the restless agony of body that arises from
an overstrained mind.&nbsp; But soon Miss Monro reappeared, bringing
with her a dose of soothing medicine of her own concocting, for she
was great in domestic quackery.&nbsp; What the medicine was Ellinor
did not care to know; she drank it without any sign of her usual merry
resistance to physic of Miss Monro&rsquo;s ordering; and as the latter
took up a book, and showed a set purpose of remaining with her patient,
Ellinor was compelled to lie still, and presently fell asleep.</p>
<p>She awakened late in the afternoon with a start.&nbsp; Her father
was standing over her, listening to Miss Monro&rsquo;s account of her
indisposition.&nbsp; She only caught one glimpse of his strangely altered
countenance, and hid her head in the cushions&mdash;hid it from memory,
not from him.&nbsp; For in an instant she must have conjectured the
interpretation he was likely to put upon her shrinking action, and she
had turned towards him, and had thrown her arms round his neck, and
was kissing his cold, passive face.&nbsp; Then she fell back.&nbsp;
But all this time their sad eyes never met&mdash;they dreaded the look
of recollection that must be in each other&rsquo;s gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, my dear!&rdquo; said Miss Monro.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now you
must lie still till I fetch you a little broth.&nbsp; You are better
now, are not you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not go for the broth, Miss Monro,&rdquo; said Mr.
Wilkins, ringing the bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fletcher can surely bring it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He dreaded the being left alone with his daughter&mdash;nor did she
fear it less.&nbsp; She heard the strange alteration in her father&rsquo;s
voice, hard and hoarse, as if it was an effort to speak.&nbsp; The physical
signs of his suffering cut her to the heart; and yet she wondered how
it was that they could both be alive, or, if alive, they were not rending
their garments and crying aloud.&nbsp; Mr. Wilkins seemed to have lost
the power of careless action and speech, it is true.&nbsp; He wished
to leave the room now his anxiety about his daughter was relieved, but
hardly knew how to set about it.&nbsp; He was obliged to think about
the veriest trifle, in order that by an effort of reason he might understand
how he should have spoken or acted if he had been free from blood-guiltiness.&nbsp;
Ellinor understood all by intuition.&nbsp; But henceforward the unspoken
comprehension of each other&rsquo;s hidden motions made their mutual
presence a burdensome anxiety to each.&nbsp; Miss Monro was a relief;
they were glad of her as a third person, unconscious of the secret which
constrained them.&nbsp; This afternoon her unconsciousness gave present
pain, although on after reflection each found in her speeches a cause
of rejoicing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mr. Dunster, Mr. Wilkins, has he come home yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment&rsquo;s pause, in which Mr. Wilkins pumped the words out
of his husky throat:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not heard.&nbsp; I have been riding.&nbsp; I went on
business to Mr. Estcourt&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Perhaps you will be so kind
as to send and inquire at Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellinor sickened at the words.&nbsp; She had been all her life a
truthful plain-spoken girl.&nbsp; She held herself high above deceit.&nbsp;
Yet, here came the necessity for deceit&mdash;a snare spread around
her.&nbsp; She had not revolted so much from the deed which brought
unpremeditated death, as she did from these words of her father&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
The night before, in her mad fever of affright, she had fancied that
to conceal the body was all that would be required; she had not looked
forward to the long, weary course of small lies, to be done and said,
involved in that one mistaken action.&nbsp; Yet, while her father&rsquo;s
words made her soul revolt, his appearance melted her heart, as she
caught it, half turned away from her, neither looking straight at Miss
Monro, nor at anything materially visible.&nbsp; His hollow sunken eye
seemed to Ellinor to have a vision of the dead man before it.&nbsp;
His cheek was livid and worn, and its healthy colouring gained by years
of hearty out-door exercise, was all gone into the wanness of age.&nbsp;
His hair, even to Ellinor, seemed greyer for the past night of wretchedness.&nbsp;
He stooped, and looked dreamily earthward, where formerly he had stood
erect.&nbsp; It needed all the pity called forth by such observation
to quench Ellinor&rsquo;s passionate contempt for the course on which
she and her father were embarked, when she heard him repeat his words
to the servant who came with her broth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fletcher! go to Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s and inquire if Mr. Dunster
is come home yet.&nbsp; I want to speak to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To him!&rdquo; lying dead where he had been laid; killed by
the man who now asked for his presence.&nbsp; Ellinor shut her eyes,
and lay back in despair.&nbsp; She wished she might die, and be out
of this horrible tangle of events.</p>
<p>Two minutes after, she was conscious of her father and Miss Monro
stealing softly out of the room.&nbsp; They thought that she slept.</p>
<p>She sprang off the sofa and knelt down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God,&rdquo; she prayed, &ldquo;Thou knowest!&nbsp; Help
me!&nbsp; There is none other help but Thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I suppose she fainted.&nbsp; For, an hour or more afterwards Miss
Monro, coming in, found her lying insensible by the side of the sofa.</p>
<p>She was carried to bed.&nbsp; She was not delirious, she was only
in a stupor, which they feared might end in delirium.&nbsp; To obviate
this, her father sent far and wide for skilful physicians, who tended
her, almost at the rate of a guinea the minute.</p>
<p>People said how hard it was upon Mr. Wilkins, that scarcely had that
wretch Dunster gone off, with no one knows how much out of the trusts
of the firm, before his only child fell ill.&nbsp; And, to tell the
truth, he himself looked burnt and scared with affliction.&nbsp; He
had a startled look, they said, as if he never could tell, after such
experience, from which side the awful proofs of the uncertainty of earth
would appear, the terrible phantoms of unforeseen dread.&nbsp; Both
rich and poor, town and country, sympathised with him.&nbsp; The rich
cared not to press their claims, or their business, at such a time;
and only wondered, in their superficial talk after dinner, how such
a good fellow as Wilkins could ever have been deceived by a man like
Dunster.&nbsp; Even Sir Frank Holster and his lady forgot their old
quarrel, and came to inquire after Ellinor, and sent her hothouse fruit
by the bushel.</p>
<p>Mr. Corbet behaved as an anxious lover should do.&nbsp; He wrote
daily to Miss Monro to beg for the most minute bulletins; he procured
everything in town that any doctor even fancied might be of service,
he came down as soon as there was the slightest hint of permission that
Ellinor might see him.&nbsp; He overpowered her with tender words and
caresses, till at last she shrank away from them, as from something
too bewildering, and past all right comprehension.</p>
<p>But one night before this, when all windows and doors stood open
to admit the least breath that stirred the sultry July air, a servant
on velvet tiptoe had stolen up to Ellinor&rsquo;s open door, and had
beckoned out of the chamber of the sleeper the ever watchful nurse,
Miss Monro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gentleman wants you,&rdquo; were all the words the housemaid
dared to say so close to the bedroom.&nbsp; And softly, softly Miss
Monro stepped down the stairs, into the drawing-room; and there she
saw Mr. Livingstone.&nbsp; But she did not know him; she had never seen
him before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have travelled all day.&nbsp; I heard she was ill&mdash;was
dying.&nbsp; May I just have one more look at her?&nbsp; I will not
speak; I will hardly breathe.&nbsp; Only let me see her once again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir, but I don&rsquo;t know who you are;
and if you mean Miss Wilkins, by &lsquo;her,&rsquo; she is very ill,
but we hope not dying.&nbsp; She was very ill, indeed, yesterday; very
dangerously ill, I may say, but she is having a good sleep, in consequence
of a soporific medicine, and we are really beginning to hope&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But just here Miss Monro&rsquo;s hand was taken, and, to her infinite
surprise, was kissed before she could remember how improper such behaviour
was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, madam, for saying so.&nbsp; But if she sleeps,
will you let me see her? it can do no harm, for I will tread as if on
egg shells; and I have come so far&mdash;if I might just look on her
sweet face.&nbsp; Pray, madam, let me just have one sight of her.&nbsp;
I will not ask for more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he did ask for more after he had had his wish.&nbsp; He stole
upstairs after Miss Monro, who looked round reproachfully at him if
even a nightingale sang, or an owl hooted in the trees outside the open
windows, yet who paused to say herself, outside Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s
chamber door,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her father&rsquo;s room; he has not been in bed for six nights,
till to-night; pray do not make a noise to waken him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
on into the deep stillness of the hushed room, where one clear ray of
hidden lamp-light shot athwart the door, where a watcher, breathing
softly, sat beside the bed&mdash;where Ellinor&rsquo;s dark head lay
motionless on the white pillow, her face almost as white, her form almost
as still.&nbsp; You might have heard a pin fall.&nbsp; After a while
he moved to withdraw.&nbsp; Miss Monro, jealous of every sound, followed
him, with steps all the more heavy because they were taken with so much
care, down the stairs, back into the drawing-room.&nbsp; By the bed-candle
flaring in the draught, she saw that there was the glittering mark of
wet tears on his cheek; and she felt, as she said afterwards, &ldquo;sorry
for the young man.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet she urged him to go, for she
knew that she might be wanted upstairs.&nbsp; He took her hand, and
wrung it hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&nbsp; She looked so changed&mdash;oh! she looked
as though she were dead.&nbsp; You will write&mdash;Herbert Livingstone,
Langham Vicarage, Yorkshire; you will promise me to write.&nbsp; If
I could do anything for her, but I can but pray.&nbsp; Oh, my darling;
my darling! and I have no right to be with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away, there&rsquo;s a good young man,&rdquo; said Miss
Monro, all the more pressing to hurry him out by the front door, because
she was afraid of his emotion overmastering him, and making him noisy
in his demonstrations.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, I will write; I will write,
never fear!&rdquo; and she bolted the door behind him, and was thankful.</p>
<p>Two minutes afterwards there was a low tap; she undid the fastenings,
and there he stood, pale in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t tell her I came to ask about her; she might
not like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! not I!&nbsp; Poor creature, she&rsquo;s not likely
to care to hear anything this long while.&nbsp; She never roused at
Mr. Corbet&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Corbet&rsquo;s!&rdquo; said Livingstone, below his breath,
and he turned and went away; this time for good.</p>
<p>But Ellinor recovered.&nbsp; She knew she was recovering, when day
after day she felt involuntary strength and appetite return.&nbsp; Her
body seemed stronger than her will; for that would have induced her
to creep into her grave, and shut her eyes for ever on this world, so
full of troubles.</p>
<p>She lay, for the most part, with her eyes closed, very still and
quiet; but she thought with the intensity of one who seeks for lost
peace, and cannot find it.&nbsp; She began to see that if in the mad
impulses of that mad nightmare of horror, they had all strengthened
each other, and dared to be frank and open, confessing a great fault,
a greater disaster, a greater woe&mdash;which in the first instance
was hardly a crime&mdash;their future course, though sad and sorrowful,
would have been a simple and straightforward one to tread.&nbsp; But
it was not for her to undo what was done, and to reveal the error and
shame of a father.&nbsp; Only she, turning anew to God, in the solemn
and quiet watches of the night, made a covenant, that in her conduct,
her own personal individual life, she would act loyally and truthfully.&nbsp;
And as for the future, and all the terrible chances involved in it,
she would leave it in His hands&mdash;if, indeed (and here came in the
Tempter), He would watch over one whose life hereafter must seem based
upon a lie.&nbsp; Her only plea, offered &ldquo;standing afar off&rdquo;
was, &ldquo;The lie is said and done and over&mdash;it was not for my
own sake.&nbsp; Can filial piety be so overcome by the rights of justice
and truth, as to demand of me that I should reveal my father&rsquo;s
guilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father&rsquo;s severe sharp punishment began.&nbsp; He knew why
she suffered, what made her young strength falter and tremble, what
made her life seem nigh about to be quenched in death.&nbsp; Yet he
could not take his sorrow and care in the natural manner.&nbsp; He was
obliged to think how every word and deed would be construed.&nbsp; He
fancied that people were watching him with suspicious eyes, when nothing
was further from their thoughts.&nbsp; For once let the &ldquo;public&rdquo;
of any place be possessed by an idea, it is more difficult to dislodge
it than any one imagines who has not tried.&nbsp; If Mr. Wilkins had
gone into Hamley market-place, and proclaimed himself guilty of the
manslaughter of Mr. Dunster&mdash;nay, if he had detailed all the circumstances&mdash;the
people would have exclaimed, &ldquo;Poor man, he is crazed by this discovery
of the unworthiness of the man he trusted so; and no wonder&mdash;it
was such a thing to have done&mdash;to have defrauded his partner to
such an extent, and then have made off to America!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For many small circumstances, which I do not stop to detail here,
went far to prove this, as we know, unfounded supposition; and Mr. Wilkins,
who was known, from his handsome boyhood, through his comely manhood,
up to the present time, by all the people in Hamley, was an object of
sympathy and respect to every one who saw him, as he passed by, old,
and lorn, and haggard before his time, all through the evil conduct
of one, London-bred, who was as a hard, unlovely stranger to the popular
mind of this little country town.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s own servants liked him.&nbsp; The workings of
his temptations were such as they could understand.&nbsp; If he had
been hot-tempered he had also been generous, or I should rather say
careless and lavish with his money.&nbsp; And now that he was cheated
and impoverished by his partner&rsquo;s delinquency, they thought it
no wonder that he drank long and deep in the solitary evenings which
he passed at home.&nbsp; It was not that he was without invitations.&nbsp;
Every one came forward to testify their respect for him by asking him
to their houses.&nbsp; He had probably never been so universally popular
since his father&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; But, as he said, he did not care
to go into society while his daughter was so ill&mdash;he had no spirits
for company.</p>
<p>But if any one had cared to observe his conduct at home, and to draw
conclusions from it, they could have noticed that, anxious as he was
about Ellinor, he rather avoided than sought her presence, now that
her consciousness and memory were restored.&nbsp; Nor did she ask for,
or wish for him.&nbsp; The presence of each was a burden to the other.&nbsp;
Oh, sad and woeful night of May&mdash;overshadowing the coming summer
months with gloom and bitter remorse!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p>Still youth prevailed over all.&nbsp; Ellinor got well, as I have
said, even when she would fain have died.&nbsp; And the afternoon came
when she left her room.&nbsp; Miss Monro would gladly have made a festival
of her recovery, and have had her conveyed into the unused drawing-room.&nbsp;
But Ellinor begged that she might be taken into the library&mdash;into
the schoolroom&mdash;anywhere (thought she) not looking on the side
of the house on the flower-garden, which she had felt in all her illness
as a ghastly pressure lying within sight of those very windows, through
which the morning sun streamed right upon her bed&mdash;like the accusing
angel, bringing all hidden things to light.</p>
<p>And when Ellinor was better still, when the Bath-chair had been sent
up for her use, by some kindly old maid, out of Hamley, she still petitioned
that it might be kept on the lawn or town side of the house, away from
the flower-garden.</p>
<p>One day she almost screamed, when, as she was going to the front
door, she saw Dixon standing ready to draw her, instead of Fletcher
the servant who usually went.&nbsp; But she checked all demonstration
of feeling; although it was the first time she had seen him since he
and she and one more had worked their hearts out in hard bodily labour.</p>
<p>He looked so stern and ill!&nbsp; Cross, too, which she had never
seen him before.</p>
<p>As soon as they were out of immediate sight of the windows, she asked
him to stop, forcing herself to speak to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dixon, you look very poorly,&rdquo; she said, trembling as
she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t think much
of it at the time, did we, Miss Nelly?&nbsp; But it&rsquo;ll be the
death on us, I&rsquo;m thinking.&nbsp; It has aged me above a bit.&nbsp;
All my fifty years afore were but as a forenoon of child&rsquo;s play
to that night.&nbsp; Measter, too&mdash;I could a-bear a good deal,
but measter cuts through the stable-yard, and past me, wi&rsquo;out
a word, as if I was poison, or a stinking foumart.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
that as is worst, Miss Nelly, it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the poor man brushed some tears from his eyes with the back of
his withered, furrowed hand.&nbsp; Ellinor caught the infection, and
cried outright, sobbed like a child, even while she held out her little
white thin hand to his grasp.&nbsp; For as soon as he saw her emotion,
he was penitent for what he had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t now&mdash;don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was all he could
think of to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dixon!&rdquo; said she at length, &ldquo;you must not mind
it.&nbsp; You must try not to mind it.&nbsp; I see he does not like
to be reminded of that, even by seeing me.&nbsp; He tries never to be
alone with me.&nbsp; My poor old Dixon, it has spoilt my life for me;
for I don&rsquo;t think he loves me any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sobbed as if her heart would break; and now it was Dixon&rsquo;s
turn to be comforter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, dear, my blessing, he loves you above everything.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s only he can&rsquo;t a-bear the sight of us, as is but natural.&nbsp;
And if he doesn&rsquo;t fancy being alone with you, there&rsquo;s always
one as does, and that&rsquo;s a comfort at the worst of times.&nbsp;
And don&rsquo;t ye fret about what I said a minute ago.&nbsp; I were
put out because measter all but pushed me out of his way this morning,
without never a word.&nbsp; But I were an old fool for telling ye.&nbsp;
And I&rsquo;ve really forgotten why I told Fletcher I&rsquo;d drag ye
a bit about to-day.&nbsp; Th&rsquo; gardener is beginning for to wonder
as you don&rsquo;t want to see th&rsquo; annuals and bedding-out things
as you were so particular about in May.&nbsp; And I thought I&rsquo;d
just have a word wi&rsquo; ye, and then if you&rsquo;d let me, we&rsquo;d
go together just once round the flower-garden, just to say you&rsquo;ve
been, you know, and to give them chaps a bit of praise.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
only have to look on the beds, my pretty, and it must be done some time.&nbsp;
So come along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to pull resolutely in the direction of the flower-garden.&nbsp;
Ellinor bit her lips to keep in the cry of repugnance that rose to them.&nbsp;
As Dixon stopped to unlock the door, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not hardness, nothing like it; I&rsquo;ve waited
till I heerd you were better; but it&rsquo;s in for a penny in for a
pound wi&rsquo; us all; and folk may talk; and bless your little brave
heart, you&rsquo;ll stand a deal for your father&rsquo;s sake, and so
will I, though I do feel it above a bit, when he puts out his hand as
if to keep me off, and I only going to speak to him about Clipper&rsquo;s
knees; though I&rsquo;ll own I had wondered many a day when I was to
have the good-morrow master never missed sin&rsquo; he were a boy till&mdash;Well!
and now you&rsquo;ve seen the beds, and can say they looked mighty pretty,
and is done all as you wished; and we&rsquo;re got out again, and breathing
fresher air than yon sunbaked hole, with its smelling flowers, not half
so wholesome to snuff at as good stable-dung.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the good man chatted on; not without the purpose of giving Ellinor
time to recover herself; and partly also to drown his own cares, which
lay heavier on his heart than he could say.&nbsp; But he thought himself
rewarded by Ellinor&rsquo;s thanks, and warm pressure of his hard hand
as she got out at the front door, and bade him good-by.</p>
<p>The break to her days of weary monotony was the letters she constantly
received from Mr. Corbet.&nbsp; And yet here again lurked the sting.&nbsp;
He was all astonishment and indignation at Mr. Dunster&rsquo;s disappearance,
or rather flight, to America.&nbsp; And now that she was growing stronger,
he did not scruple to express curiosity respecting the details, never
doubting but that she was perfectly acquainted with much that he wanted
to know; although he had too much delicacy to question her on the point
which was most important of all in his eyes, namely, how far it had
affected Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s worldly prospects; for the report prevalent
in Hamley had reached London, that Mr. Dunster had made away with, or
carried off, trust property to a considerable extent, for all which
Mr. Wilkins would of course be liable.</p>
<p>It was hard work for Ralph Corbet to keep from seeking direct information
on this head from Mr. Ness, or, indeed, from Mr. Wilkins himself.&nbsp;
But he restrained himself, knowing that in August he should be able
to make all these inquiries personally.&nbsp; Before the end of the
long vacation he had hoped to marry Ellinor: that was the time which
had been planned by them when they had met in the early spring before
her illness and all this misfortune happened.&nbsp; But now, as he wrote
to his father, nothing could be definitely arranged until he had paid
his visit to Hamley, and seen the state of affairs.</p>
<p>Accordingly one Saturday in August, he came to Ford Bank, this time
as a visitor to Ellinor&rsquo;s home, instead of to his old quarters
at Mr. Ness&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The house was still as if asleep in the full heat of the afternoon
sun, as Mr. Corbet drove up.&nbsp; The window-blinds were down; the
front door wide open, great stands of heliotrope and roses and geraniums
stood just within the shadow of the hall; but through all the silence
his approach seemed to excite no commotion.&nbsp; He thought it strange
that he had not been watched for, that Ellinor did not come running
out to meet him, that she allowed Fletcher to come and attend to his
luggage, and usher him into the library just like any common visitor,
any morning-caller.&nbsp; He stiffened himself up into a moment&rsquo;s
indignant coldness of manner.&nbsp; But it vanished in an instant when,
on the door being opened, he saw Ellinor standing holding by the table,
looking for his appearance with almost panting anxiety.&nbsp; He thought
of nothing then but her evident weakness, her changed looks, for which
no account of her illness had prepared him.&nbsp; For she was deadly
white, lips and all; and her dark eyes seemed unnaturally enlarged,
while the caves in which they were set were strangely deep and hollow.&nbsp;
Her hair, too, had been cut off pretty closely; she did not usually
wear a cap, but with some faint idea of making herself look better in
his eye, she had put on one this day, and the effect was that she seemed
to be forty years of age; but one instant after he had come in, her
pale face was flooded with crimson, and her eyes were full of tears.&nbsp;
She had hard work to keep herself from going into hysterics, but she
instinctively knew how much he would hate a scene, and she checked herself
in time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;I am so glad to see you; it
is such a comfort, such an infinite pleasure.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so she
went on, cooing out words over him, and stroking his hair with her thin
fingers; while he rather tried to avert his eyes, he was so much afraid
of betraying how much he thought her altered.</p>
<p>But when she came down, dressed for dinner, this sense of her change
was diminished to him.&nbsp; Her short brown hair had already a little
wave, and was ornamented by some black lace; she wore a large black
lace shawl&mdash;it had been her mother&rsquo;s of old&mdash;over some
delicate-coloured muslin dress; her face was slightly flushed, and had
the tints of a wild rose; her lips kept pale and trembling with involuntary
motion, it is true; and as the lovers stood together, hand in hand,
by the window, he was aware of a little convulsive twitching at every
noise, even while she seemed gazing in tranquil pleasure on the long
smooth slope of the newly-mown lawn, stretching down to the little brook
that prattled merrily over the stones on its merry course to Hamley
town.</p>
<p>He felt a stronger twitch than ever before; even while his ear, less
delicate than hers, could distinguish no peculiar sound.&nbsp; About
two minutes after Mr. Wilkins entered the room.&nbsp; He came up to
Mr. Corbet with a warm welcome: some of it real, some of it assumed.&nbsp;
He talked volubly to him, taking little or no notice of Ellinor, who
dropped into the background, and sat down on the sofa by Miss Monro;
for on this day they were all to dine together.&nbsp; Ralph Corbet thought
that Mr. Wilkins was aged; but no wonder, after all his anxiety of various
kinds: Mr. Dunster&rsquo;s flight and reported defalcations, Ellinor&rsquo;s
illness, of the seriousness of which her lover was now convinced by
her appearance.</p>
<p>He would fain have spoken more to her during the dinner that ensued,
but Mr. Wilkins absorbed all his attention, talking and questioning
on subjects that left the ladies out of the conversation almost perpetually.&nbsp;
Mr. Corbet recognised his host&rsquo;s fine tact, even while his persistence
in talking annoyed him.&nbsp; He was quite sure that Mr. Wilkins was
anxious to spare his daughter any exertion beyond that&mdash;to which,
indeed, she seemed scarely equal&mdash;of sitting at the head of the
table.&nbsp; And the more her father talked&mdash;so fine an observer
was Mr. Corbet&mdash;the more silent and depressed Ellinor appeared.&nbsp;
But by-and-by he accounted for this inverse ratio of gaiety, as he perceived
how quickly Mr. Wilkins had his glass replenished.&nbsp; And here, again,
Mr. Corbet drew his conclusions, from the silent way in which, without
a word or a sign from his master, Fletcher gave him more wine continually&mdash;wine
that was drained off at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six glasses of sherry before dessert,&rdquo; thought Mr. Corbet
to himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bad habit&mdash;no wonder Ellinor looks grave.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And when the gentlemen were left alone, Mr. Wilkins helped himself even
still more freely; yet without the slightest effect on the clearness
and brilliancy of his conversation.&nbsp; He had always talked well
and racily, that Ralph knew, and in this power he now recognised a temptation
to which he feared that his future father-in-law had succumbed.&nbsp;
And yet, while he perceived that this gift led into temptation, he coveted
it for himself; for he was perfectly aware that this fluency, this happy
choice of epithets, was the one thing he should fail in when he began
to enter into the more active career of his profession.&nbsp; But after
some time spent in listening, and admiring, with this little feeling
of envy lurking in the background, Mr. Corbet became aware of Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s
increasing confusion of ideas, and rather unnatural merriment; and,
with a sudden revulsion from admiration to disgust, he rose up to go
into the library, where Ellinor and Miss Monro were sitting.&nbsp; Mr.
Wilkins accompanied him, laughing and talking somewhat loudly.&nbsp;
Was Ellinor aware of her father&rsquo;s state?&nbsp; Of that Mr. Corbet
could not be sure.&nbsp; She looked up with grave sad eyes as they came
into the room, but with no apparent sensation of surprise, annoyance,
or shame.&nbsp; When her glance met her father&rsquo;s, Mr. Corbet noticed
that it seemed to sober the latter immediately.&nbsp; He sat down near
the open window, and did not speak, but sighed heavily from time to
time.&nbsp; Miss Monro took up a book, in order to leave the young people
to themselves; and after a little low murmured conversation, Ellinor
went upstairs to put on her things for a stroll through the meadows
by the river-side.</p>
<p>They were sometimes sauntering along in the lovely summer twilight,
now resting on some grassy hedge-row bank, or standing still, looking
at the great barges, with their crimson sails, lazily floating down
the river, making ripples on the glassy opal surface of the water.&nbsp;
They did not talk very much; Ellinor seemed disinclined for the exertion;
and her lover was thinking over Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s behaviour, with
some surprise and distaste of the habit so evidently growing upon him.</p>
<p>They came home, looking serious and tired: yet they could not account
for their fatigue by the length of their walk, and Miss Monro, forgetting
Autolycus&rsquo;s song, kept fidgeting about Ellinor, and wondering
how it was she looked so pale, if she had only been as far as the Ash
Meadow.&nbsp; To escape from this wonder, Ellinor went early to bed.&nbsp;
Mr. Wilkins was gone, no one knew where, and Ralph and Miss Monro were
left to a half-hour&rsquo;s <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>.&nbsp;
He thought he could easily account for Ellinor&rsquo;s languor, if,
indeed, she had perceived as much as he had done of her father&rsquo;s
state, when they had come into the library after dinner.&nbsp; But there
were many details which he was anxious to hear from a comparatively
indifferent person, and as soon as he could, he passed on from the conversation
about Ellinor&rsquo;s health, to inquiries as to the whole affair of
Mr. Dunster&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>Next to her anxiety about Ellinor, Miss Monro liked to dilate on
the mystery connected with Mr. Dunster&rsquo;s flight; for that was
the word she employed without hesitation, as she gave him the account
of the event universally received and believed in by the people of Hamley.&nbsp;
How Mr. Dunster had never been liked by any one; how everybody remembered
that he could never look them straight in the face; how he always seemed
to be hiding something that he did not want to have known; how he had
drawn a large sum (exact quantity unknown) out of the county bank only
the day before he left Hamley, doubtless in preparation for his escape;
how some one had told Mr. Wilkins he had seen a man just like Dunster
lurking about the docks at Liverpool, about two days after he had left
his lodgings, but that this some one, being in a hurry, had not cared
to stop and speak to the man; how that the affairs in the office were
discovered to be in such a sad state that it was no wonder that Mr.
Dunster had absconded&mdash;he that had been so trusted by poor dear
Mr. Wilkins.&nbsp; Money gone no one knew how or where.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But has he no friends who can explain his proceedings, and
account for the missing money, in some way?&rdquo; asked Mr. Corbet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, none.&nbsp; Mr. Wilkins has written everywhere, right
and left, I believe.&nbsp; I know he had a letter from Mr. Dunster&rsquo;s
nearest relation&mdash;a tradesman in the City&mdash;a cousin, I think,
and he could give no information in any way.&nbsp; He knew that about
ten years ago Mr. Dunster had had a great fancy for going to America,
and had read a great many travels&mdash;all just what a man would do
before going off to a country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten years is a long time beforehand,&rdquo; said Mr. Corbet,
half smiling; &ldquo;shows malice prepense with a vengeance.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But then, turning grave, he said: &ldquo;Did he leave Hamley in debt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I never heard of that,&rdquo; said Miss Monro, rather
unwillingly, for she considered it as a piece of loyalty to the Wilkinses,
whom Mr. Dunster had injured (as she thought) to blacken his character
as much as was consistent with any degree of truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a strange story,&rdquo; said Mr. Corbet, musing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; she replied, quickly; &ldquo;I am sure,
if you had seen the man, with one or two side-locks of hair combed over
his baldness, as if he were ashamed of it, and his eyes that never looked
at you, and his way of eating with his knife when he thought he was
not observed&mdash;oh, and numbers of things!&mdash;you would not think
it strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Corbet smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only meant that he seems to have had no extravagant or vicious
habits which would account for his embezzlement of the money that is
missing&mdash;but, to be sure, money in itself is a temptation&mdash;only
he, being a partner, was in a fair way of making it without risk to
himself.&nbsp; Has Mr. Wilkins taken any steps to have him arrested
in America?&nbsp; He might easily do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear Mr. Ralph, you don&rsquo;t know our good Mr. Wilkins!&nbsp;
He would rather bear the loss, I am sure, and all this trouble and care
which it has brought upon him, than be revenged upon Mr. Dunster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Revenged!&nbsp; What nonsense!&nbsp; It is simple justice&mdash;justice
to himself and to others&mdash;to see that villainy is so sufficiently
punished as to deter others from entering upon such courses.&nbsp; But
I have little doubt Mr. Wilkins has taken the right steps; he is not
the man to sit down quietly under such a loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed! he had him advertised in the <i>Times</i> and
in the county papers, and offered a reward of twenty pounds for information
concerning him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty pounds was too little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I said.&nbsp; I told Ellinor that I would give twenty pounds
myself to have him apprehended, and she, poor darling! fell a-trembling,
and said, &lsquo;I would give all I have&mdash;I would give my life.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And then she was in such distress, and sobbed so, I promised her I would
never name it to her again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor child&mdash;poor child! she wants change of scene.&nbsp;
Her nerves have been sadly shaken by her illness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day was Sunday; Ellinor was to go to church for the first
time since her illness.&nbsp; Her father had decided it for her, or
else she would fain have stayed away&mdash;she would hardly acknowledge
why, even to herself, but it seemed to her as if the very words and
presence of God must there search her and find her out.</p>
<p>She went early, leaning on the arm of her lover, and trying to forget
the past in the present.&nbsp; They walked slowly along between the
rows of waving golden corn ripe for the harvest.&nbsp; Mr. Corbet gathered
blue and scarlet flowers, and made up a little rustic nosegay for her.&nbsp;
She took and stuck it in her girdle, smiling faintly as she did so.</p>
<p>Hamley Church had, in former days, been collegiate, and was, in consequence,
much larger and grander than the majority of country-town churches.&nbsp;
The Ford Bank pew was a square one, downstairs; the Ford Bank servants
sat in a front pew in the gallery, right before their master.&nbsp;
Ellinor was &ldquo;hardening her heart&rdquo; not to listen, not to
hearken to what might disturb the wound which was just being skinned
over, when she caught Dixon&rsquo;s face up above.&nbsp; He looked worn,
sad, soured, and anxious to a miserable degree; but he was straining
eyes and ears, heart and soul, to hear the solemn words read from the
pulpit, as if in them alone he could find help in his strait.&nbsp;
Ellinor felt rebuked and humbled.</p>
<p>She was in a tumultuous state of mind when they left church; she
wished to do her duty, yet could not ascertain what it was.&nbsp; Who
was to help her with wisdom and advice?&nbsp; Assuredly he to whom her
future life was to be trusted.&nbsp; But the case must be stated in
an impersonal form.&nbsp; No one, not even her husband, must ever know
anything against her father from her.&nbsp; Ellinor was so artless herself,
that she had little idea how quickly and easily some people can penetrate
motives, and combine disjointed sentences.&nbsp; She began to speak
to Ralph on their slow, sauntering walk homewards through the quiet
meadows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose, Ralph, that a girl was engaged to be married&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can very easily suppose that, with you by me,&rdquo; said
he, filling up her pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but I don&rsquo;t mean myself at all,&rdquo; replied she,
reddening.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am only thinking of what might happen; and
suppose that this girl knew of some one belonging to her&mdash;we will
call it a brother&mdash;who had done something wrong, that would bring
disgrace upon the whole family if it was known&mdash;though, indeed,
it might not have been so very wrong as it seemed, and as it would look
to the world&mdash;ought she to break off her engagement for fear of
involving her lover in the disgrace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, without telling him her reason for doing so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! but suppose she could not.&nbsp; She might not be at liberty
to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t answer supposititious cases.&nbsp; I must have
the facts&mdash;if facts there are&mdash;more plainly before me before
I can give an opinion.&nbsp; Who are you thinking of, Ellinor?&rdquo;
asked he, rather abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of no one,&rdquo; she answered in affright.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
should I be thinking of any one?&nbsp; I often try to plan out what
I should do, or what I ought to do, if such and such a thing happened,
just as you recollect I used to wonder if I should have presence of
mind in case of fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, after all, you yourself are the girl who is engaged,
and who has the imaginary brother who gets into disgrace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; said she, a little annoyed at having
betrayed any personal interest in the affair.</p>
<p>He was silent, meditating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing wrong in it,&rdquo; said she, timidly, &ldquo;is
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you had better tell me fully out what is in your mind,&rdquo;
he replied, kindly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Something has happened which has suggested
these questions.&nbsp; Are you putting yourself in the place of any
one about whom you have been hearing lately?&nbsp; I know you used to
do so formerly, when you were a little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it was a very foolish question of mine, and I ought not
to have said anything about it.&nbsp; See! here is Mr. Ness overtaking
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clergyman joined them on the broad walk that ran by the river-side,
and the talk became general.&nbsp; It was a relief to Ellinor, who had
not attained her end, but who had gone far towards betraying something
of her own individual interest in the question she had asked.&nbsp;
Ralph had been more struck even by her manner than her words.&nbsp;
He was sure that something lurked behind, and had an idea of his own
that it was connected with Dunster&rsquo;s disappearance.&nbsp; But
he was glad that Mr. Ness&rsquo;s joining them gave him leisure to consider
a little.</p>
<p>The end of his reflections was, that the next day, Monday, he went
into the town, and artfully learnt all he could hear about Mr Dunster&rsquo;s
character and mode of going on; and with still more skill he extracted
the popular opinion as to the embarrassed nature of Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s
affairs&mdash;embarrassment which was generally attributed to Dunster&rsquo;s
disappearance with a good large sum belonging to the firm in his possession.&nbsp;
But Mr. Corbet thought otherwise; he had accustomed himself to seek
out the baser motives for men&rsquo;s conduct, and to call the result
of these researches wisdom.&nbsp; He imagined that Dunster had been
well paid by Mr. Wilkins for his disappearance, which was an easy way
of accounting for the derangement of accounts and loss of money that
arose, in fact, from Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s extravagance of habits and
growing intemperance.</p>
<p>On the Monday afternoon he said to Ellinor, &ldquo;Mr. Ness interrupted
us yesterday in a very interesting conversation.&nbsp; Do you remember,
love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellinor reddened and kept her head still more intently bent over
a sketch she was making.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I recollect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking about it.&nbsp; I still think she ought
to tell her lover that such disgrace hung over him&mdash;I mean, over
the family with whom he was going to connect himself.&nbsp; Of course,
the only effect would be to make him stand by her still more for her
frankness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but, Ralph, it might perhaps be something she ought not
to tell, whatever came of her silence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course there might be all sorts of cases.&nbsp; Unless
I knew more I could not pretend to judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was said rather more coolly.&nbsp; It had the desired effect.&nbsp;
Ellinor laid down her brush, and covered her face with her hand.&nbsp;
After a pause, she turned towards him and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you this; and more you must not ask me.&nbsp;
I know you are as safe as can be.&nbsp; I am the girl, you are the lover,
and possible shame hangs over my father, if something&mdash;oh, so dreadful&rdquo;
(here she blanched), &ldquo;but not so very much his fault, is ever
found out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though this was nothing more than he expected, though Ralph thought
that he was aware what the dreadful something might be, yet, when it
was acknowledged in words, his heart contracted, and for a moment he
forgot the intent, wistful, beautiful face, creeping close to his to
read his expression aright.&nbsp; But after that his presence of mind
came in aid.&nbsp; He took her in his arms and kissed her; murmuring
fond words of sympathy, and promises of faith, nay, even of greater
love than before, since greater need she might have of that love.&nbsp;
But somehow he was glad when the dressing-bell rang, and in the solitude
of his own room he could reflect on what he had heard; for the intelligence
had been a great shock to him, although he had fancied that his morning&rsquo;s
inquiries had prepared him for it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p>Ralph Corbet found it a very difficult thing to keep down his curiosity
during the next few days.&nbsp; It was a miserable thing to have Ellinor&rsquo;s
unspoken secret severing them like a phantom.&nbsp; But he had given
her his word that he would make no further inquiries from her.&nbsp;
Indeed, he thought he could well enough make out the outline of past
events; still, there was too much left to conjecture for his mind not
to be always busy on the subject.&nbsp; He felt inclined to probe Mr.
Wilkins in their after-dinner conversation, in which his host was frank
and lax enough on many subjects.&nbsp; But once touch on the name of
Dunster and Mr. Wilkins sank into a kind of suspicious depression of
spirits; talking little, and with evident caution; and from time to
time shooting furtive glances at his interlocutor&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;
Ellinor was resolutely impervious to any attempts of his to bring his
conversation with her back to the subject which more and more engrossed
Ralph Corbet&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; She had done her duty, as she understood
it; and had received assurances which she was only too glad to believe
fondly with all the tender faith of her heart.&nbsp; Whatever came to
pass, Ralph&rsquo;s love would still be hers; nor was he unwarned of
what might come to pass in some dread future day.&nbsp; So she shut
her eyes to what might be in store for her (and, after all, the chances
were immeasurably in her favour); and she bent herself with her whole
strength into enjoying the present.&nbsp; Day by day Mr. Corbet&rsquo;s
spirits flagged.&nbsp; He was, however, so generally uniform in the
tenor of his talk&mdash;never very merry, and always avoiding any subject
that might call out deep feeling either on his own or any one else&rsquo;s
part, that few people were aware of his changes of mood.&nbsp; Ellinor
felt them, though she would not acknowledge them: it was bringing her
too much face to face with the great terror of her life.</p>
<p>One morning he announced the fact of his brother&rsquo;s approaching
marriage; the wedding was hastened on account of some impending event
in the duke&rsquo;s family; and the home letter he had received that
day was to bid his presence at Stokely Castle, and also to desire him
to be at home by a certain time not very distant, in order to look over
the requisite legal papers, and to give his assent to some of them.&nbsp;
He gave many reasons why this unlooked-for departure of his was absolutely
necessary; but no one doubted it.&nbsp; He need not have alleged such
reiterated excuses.&nbsp; The truth was, he was restrained and uncomfortable
at Ford Bank ever since Ellinor&rsquo;s confidence.&nbsp; He could not
rightly calculate on the most desirable course for his own interests,
while his love for her was constantly being renewed by her sweet presence.&nbsp;
Away from her, he could judge more wisely.&nbsp; Nor did he allege any
false reasons for his departure; but the sense of relief to himself
was so great at his recall home, that he was afraid of having it perceived
by others; and so took the very way which, if others had been as penetrating
as himself, would have betrayed him.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilkins, too, had begun to feel the restraint of Ralph&rsquo;s
grave watchful presence.&nbsp; Ellinor was not strong enough to be married;
nor was the promised money forthcoming if she had been.&nbsp; And to
have a fellow dawdling about the house all day, sauntering into the
flower-garden, peering about everywhere, and having a kind of right
to put all manner of unexpected questions, was anything but agreeable.&nbsp;
It was only Ellinor that clung to his presence&mdash;clung as though
some shadow of what might happen before they met again had fallen on
her spirit.&nbsp; As soon as he had left the house she flew up to a
spare bedroom window, to watch for the last glimpse of the fly which
was taking him into the town.&nbsp; And then she kissed the part of
the pane on which his figure, waving an arm out of the carriage window,
had last appeared; and went down slowly to gather together all the things
he had last touched&mdash;the pen he had mended, the flower he had played
with, and to lock them up in the little quaint cabinet that had held
her treasures since she was a tiny child.</p>
<p>Miss Monro was, perhaps, very wise in proposing the translation of
a difficult part of Dante for a distraction to Ellinor.&nbsp; The girl
went meekly, if reluctantly, to the task set her by her good governess,
and by-and-by her mind became braced by the exertion.</p>
<p>Ralph&rsquo;s people were not very slow in discovering that something
had not gone on quite smoothly with him at Ford Bank.&nbsp; They knew
his ways and looks with family intuition, and could easily be certain
thus far.&nbsp; But not even his mother&rsquo;s skilfulest wiles, nor
his favourite sister&rsquo;s coaxing, could obtain a word or a hint;
and when his father, the squire, who had heard the opinions of the female
part of the family on this head, began, in his honest blustering way,
in their <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes</i> after dinner, to hope
that Ralph was thinking better than to run his head into that confounded
Hamley attorney&rsquo;s noose, Ralph gravely required Mr. Corbet to
explain his meaning, which he professed not to understand so worded.&nbsp;
And when the squire had, with much perplexity, put it into the plain
terms of hoping that his son was thinking of breaking off his engagement
to Miss Wilkins, Ralph coolly asked him if he was aware that, in that
case, he should lose all title to being a man of honour, and might have
an action brought against him for breach of promise?</p>
<p>Yet not the less for all this was the idea in his mind as a future
possibility.</p>
<p>Before very long the Corbet family moved <i>en masse</i> to Stokely
Castle for the wedding.&nbsp; Of course, Ralph associated on equal terms
with the magnates of the county, who were the employers of Ellinor&rsquo;s
father, and spoke of him always as &ldquo;Wilkins,&rdquo; just as they
spoke of the butler as &ldquo;Simmons.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, too, among
a class of men high above local gossip, and thus unaware of his engagement,
he learnt the popular opinion respecting his future father-in-law; an
opinion not entirely respectful, though intermingled with a good deal
of personal liking.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor Wilkins,&rdquo; as they called
him, &ldquo;was sadly extravagant for a man in his position; had no
right to spend money, and act as if he were a man of independent fortune.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His habits of life were criticised; and pity, not free from blame, was
bestowed upon him for the losses he had sustained from his late clerk&rsquo;s
disappearance and defalcation.&nbsp; But what could be expected if a
man did not choose to attend to his own business?</p>
<p>The wedding went by, as grand weddings do, without let or hindrance,
according to the approved pattern.&nbsp; A Cabinet minister honoured
it with his presence, and, being a distant relation of the Brabants,
remained for a few days after the grand occasion.&nbsp; During this
time he became rather intimate with Ralph Corbet; many of their tastes
were in common.&nbsp; Ralph took a great interest in the manner of working
out political questions; in the balance and state of parties; and had
the right appreciation of the exact qualities on which the minister
piqued himself.&nbsp; In return, the latter was always on the look-out
for promising young men, who, either by their capability of speech-making
or article-writing, might advance the views of his party.&nbsp; Recognising
the powers he most valued in Ralph, he spared no pains to attach him
to his own political set.&nbsp; When they separated, it was with the
full understanding that they were to see a good deal of each other in
London.</p>
<p>The holiday Ralph allowed himself was passing rapidly away; but,
before he returned to his chambers and his hard work, he had promised
to spend a few more days with Ellinor; and it suited him to go straight
from the duke&rsquo;s to Ford Bank.&nbsp; He left the castle soon after
breakfast&mdash;the luxurious, elegant breakfast, served by domestics
who performed their work with the accuracy and perfection of machines.&nbsp;
He arrived at Ford Bank before the man-servant had quite finished the
dirtier part of his morning&rsquo;s work, and he came to the glass-door
in his striped cotton jacket, a little soiled, and rolling up his working
apron.&nbsp; Ellinor was not yet strong enough to get up and go out
and gather flowers for the rooms, so those left from yesterday were
rather faded; in short, the contrast from entire completeness and exquisite
freshness of arrangement struck forcibly upon Ralph&rsquo;s perceptions,
which were critical rather than appreciative; and, as his affections
were always subdued to his intellect, Ellinor&rsquo;s lovely face and
graceful figure flying to meet him did not gain his full approval, because
her hair was dressed in an old-fashioned way, her waist was either too
long or too short, her sleeves too full or too tight for the standard
of fashion to which his eye had been accustomed while scanning the bridesmaids
and various highborn ladies at Stokely Castle.</p>
<p>But, as he had always piqued himself upon being able to put on one
side all superficial worldliness in his chase after power, it did not
do for him to shrink from seeing and facing the incompleteness of moderate
means.&nbsp; Only marriage upon moderate means was gradually becoming
more distasteful to him.</p>
<p>Nor did his subsequent intercourse with Lord Bolton, the Cabinet
minister before mentioned, tend to reconcile him to early matrimony.&nbsp;
At Lord Bolton&rsquo;s house he met polished and intellectual society,
and all that smoothness in ministering to the lower wants in eating
and drinking which seems to provide that the right thing shall always
be at the right place at the right time, so that the want of it shall
never impede for an instant the feast of wit or reason; while, if he
went to the houses of his friends, men of the same college and standing
as himself, who had been seduced into early marriages, he was uncomfortably
aware of numerous inconsistencies and hitches in their <i>m&eacute;nages</i>.&nbsp;
Besides, the idea of the possible disgrace that might befall the family
with which he thought of allying himself haunted him with the tenacity
and also with the exaggeration of a nightmare, whenever he had overworked
himself in his search after available and profitable knowledge, or had
a fit of indigestion after the exquisite dinners he was learning so
well to appreciate.</p>
<p>Christmas was, of course, to be devoted to his own family; it was
an unavoidable necessity, as he told Ellinor, while, in reality, he
was beginning to find absence from his betrothed something of a relief.&nbsp;
Yet the wranglings and folly of his home, even blessed by the presence
of a Lady Maria, made him look forward to Easter at Ford Bank with something
of the old pleasure.</p>
<p>Ellinor, with the fine tact which love gives, had discovered his
annoyance at various little incongruities in the household at the time
of his second visit in the previous autumn, and had laboured to make
all as perfect as she could before his return.&nbsp; But she had much
to struggle against.&nbsp; For the first time in her life there was
a great want of ready money; she could scarcely obtain the servants&rsquo;
wages; and the bill for the spring seeds was a heavy weight on her conscience.&nbsp;
For Miss Monro&rsquo;s methodical habits had taught her pupil great
exactitude as to all money matters.</p>
<p>Then her father&rsquo;s temper had become very uncertain.&nbsp; He
avoided being alone with her whenever he possibly could; and the consciousness
of this, and of the terrible mutual secret which was the cause of this
estrangement, were the reasons why Ellinor never recovered her pretty
youthful bloom after her illness.&nbsp; Of course it was to this that
the outside world attributed her changed appearance.&nbsp; They would
shake their heads and say, &ldquo;Ah, poor Miss Wilkins!&nbsp; What
a lovely creature she was before that fever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But youth is youth, and will assert itself in a certain elasticity
of body and spirits; and at times Ellinor forgot that fearful night
for several hours together.&nbsp; Even when her father&rsquo;s averted
eye brought it all once more before her, she had learnt to form excuses
and palliations, and to regard Mr. Dunster&rsquo;s death as only the
consequence of an unfortunate accident.&nbsp; But she tried to put the
miserable remembrance entirely out of her mind; to go on from day to
day thinking only of the day, and how to arrange it so as to cause the
least irritation to her father.&nbsp; She would so gladly have spoken
to him on the one subject which overshadowed all their intercourse;
she fancied that by speaking she might have been able to banish the
phantom, or reduce its terror to what she believed to be the due proportion.&nbsp;
But her father was evidently determined to show that he was never more
to be spoken to on that subject; and all she could do was to follow
his lead on the rare occasions that they fell into something like the
old confidential intercourse.&nbsp; As yet, to her, he had never given
way to anger; but before her he had often spoken in a manner which both
pained and terrified her.&nbsp; Sometimes his eye in the midst of his
passion caught on her face of affright and dismay, and then he would
stop, and make such an effort to control himself as sometimes ended
in tears.&nbsp; Ellinor did not understand that both these phases were
owing to his increasing habit of drinking more than he ought to have
done.&nbsp; She set them down as the direct effects of a sorely burdened
conscience; and strove more and more to plan for his daily life at home,
how it should go on with oiled wheels, neither a jerk nor a jar.&nbsp;
It was no wonder she looked wistful, and careworn, and old.&nbsp; Miss
Monro was her great comfort; the total unconsciousness on that lady&rsquo;s
part of anything below the surface, and yet her full and delicate recognition
of all the little daily cares and trials, made her sympathy most valuable
to Ellinor, while there was no need to fear that it would ever give
Miss Monro that power of seeing into the heart of things which it frequently
confers upon imaginative people, who are deeply attached to some one
in sorrow.</p>
<p>There was a strong bond between Ellinor and Dixon, although they
scarcely ever exchanged a word save on the most common-place subjects;
but their silence was based on different feelings from that which separated
Ellinor from her father.&nbsp; Ellinor and Dixon could not speak freely,
because their hearts were full of pity for the faulty man whom they
both loved so well, and tried so hard to respect.</p>
<p>This was the state of the household to which Ralph Corbet came down
at Easter.&nbsp; He might have been known in London as a brilliant diner-out
by this time; but he could not afford to throw his life away in fireworks;
he calculated his forces, and condensed their power as much as might
be, only visiting where he was likely to meet men who could help in
his future career.&nbsp; He had been invited to spend the Easter vacation
at a certain country house which would be full of such human stepping-stones;
and he declined in order to keep his word to Ellinor, and go to Ford
Bank.&nbsp; But he could not help looking upon himself a little in the
light of a martyr to duty; and perhaps this view of his own merits made
him chafe under his future father-in-law&rsquo;s irritability of manner,
which now showed itself even to him.&nbsp; He found himself distinctly
regretting that he had suffered himself to be engaged so early in life;
and having become conscious of the temptation and not having repelled
it at once, of course it returned and returned, and gradually obtained
the mastery over him.&nbsp; What was to be gained by keeping to his
engagement with Ellinor?&nbsp; He should have a delicate wife to look
after, and even more than the common additional expenses of married
life.&nbsp; He should have a father-in-law whose character at best had
had only a local and provincial respectability, which it was now daily
losing by habits which were both sensual and vulgarising; a man, too,
who was strangely changing from joyous geniality into moody surliness.&nbsp;
Besides, he doubted if, in the evident change in the prosperity of the
family, the fortune to be paid down on the occasion of his marriage
to Ellinor could be forthcoming.&nbsp; And above all, and around all,
there hovered the shadow of some unrevealed disgrace, which might come
to light at any time and involve him in it.&nbsp; He thought he had
pretty well ascertained the nature of this possible shame, and had little
doubt it would turn out to be that Dunster&rsquo;s disappearance, to
America or elsewhere, had been an arranged plan with Mr. Wilkins.&nbsp;
Although Mr. Ralph Corbet was capable of suspecting him of this mean
crime (so far removed from the impulsive commission of the past sin
which was dragging him daily lower and lower down), it was of a kind
that was peculiarly distasteful to the acute lawyer, who foresaw how
such base conduct would taint all whose names were ever mentioned, even
by chance, in connection with it.&nbsp; He used to lie miserably tossing
on his sleepless bed, turning over these things in the night season.&nbsp;
He was tormented by all these thoughts; he would bitterly regret the
past events that connected him with Ellinor, from the day when he first
came to read with Mr. Ness up to the present time.&nbsp; But when he
came down in the morning, and saw the faded Ellinor flash into momentary
beauty at his entrance into the dining-room, and when she blushingly
drew near with the one single flower freshly gathered, which it had
been her custom to place in his button-hole when he came down to breakfast,
he felt as if his better self was stronger than temptation, and as if
he must be an honest man and honourable lover, even against his wish.</p>
<p>As the day wore on the temptation gathered strength.&nbsp; Mr. Wilkins
came down, and while he was on the scene Ellinor seemed always engrossed
by her father, who apparently cared little enough for all her attentions.&nbsp;
Then there was a complaining of the food, which did not suit the sickly
palate of a man who had drunk hard the night before; and possibly these
complaints were extended to the servants, and their incompleteness or
incapacity was thus brought prominently before the eyes of Ralph, who
would have preferred to eat a dry crust in silence, or to have gone
without breakfast altogether, if he could have had intellectual conversation
of some high order, to having the greatest dainties with the knowledge
of the care required in their preparation thus coarsely discussed before
him.&nbsp; By the time such breakfasts were finished, Ellinor looked
thirty, and her spirits were gone for the day.&nbsp; It had become difficult
for Ralph to contract his mind to her small domestic interests, and
she had little else to talk to him about, now that he responded but
curtly to all her questions about himself, and was weary of professing
a love which he was ceasing to feel, in all the passionate nothings
which usually make up so much of lovers&rsquo; talk.&nbsp; The books
she had been reading were old classics, whose place in literature no
longer admitted of keen discussion; the poor whom she cared for were
all very well in their way; and, if they could have been brought in
to illustrate a theory, hearing about them might have been of some use;
but, as it was, it was simply tiresome to hear day after day of Betty
Palmer&rsquo;s rheumatism and Mrs. Kay&rsquo;s baby&rsquo;s fits.&nbsp;
There was no talking politics with her, because she was so ignorant
that she always agreed with everything he said.</p>
<p>He even grew to find luncheon and Miss Monro not unpleasant varieties
to his monotonous <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes</i>.&nbsp; Then
came the walk, generally to the town to fetch Mr. Wilkins from his office;
and once or twice it was pretty evident how he had been employing his
hours.&nbsp; One day in particular his walk was so unsteady and his
speech so thick, that Ralph could only wonder how it was that Ellinor
did not perceive the cause; but she was too openly anxious about the
headache of which her father complained to have been at all aware of
the previous self-indulgence which must have brought it on.&nbsp; This
very afternoon, as ill-luck would have it, the Duke of Hinton and a
gentleman whom Ralph had met in town at Lord Bolton&rsquo;s rode by,
and recognised him; saw Ralph supporting a tipsy man with such quiet
friendly interest as must show all passers-by that they were previous
friends.&nbsp; Mr. Corbet chafed and fumed inwardly all the way home
after this unfortunate occurrence; he was in a thoroughly evil temper
before they reached Ford Bank, but he had too much self-command to let
this be very apparent.&nbsp; He turned into the shrubbery paths, leaving
Ellinor to take her father into the quietness of his own room, there
to lie down and shake off his headache.</p>
<p>Ralph walked along, ruminating in gloomy mood as to what was to be
done; how he could best extricate himself from the miserable relation
in which he had placed himself by giving way to impulse.&nbsp; Almost
before he was aware, a little hand stole within his folded arms, and
Ellinor&rsquo;s sweet sad eyes looked into his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have put papa down for an hour&rsquo;s rest before dinner,&rdquo;
said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;His head seems to ache terribly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph was silent and unsympathising, trying to nerve himself up to
be disagreeable, but finding it difficult in the face of such sweet
trust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember our conversation last autumn, Ellinor?&rdquo;
he began at length.</p>
<p>Her head sunk.&nbsp; They were near a garden-seat, and she quietly
sat down, without speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About some disgrace which you then fancied hung over you?&rdquo;&nbsp;
No answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Does it still hang over you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she whispered, with a heavy sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your father knows this, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; again, in the same tone; and then silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is doing him harm,&rdquo; at length Ralph went
on, decidedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid it is,&rdquo; she said, in a low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would tell me what it is,&rdquo; he said, a little
impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I might be able to help you about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! you could not,&rdquo; replied Ellinor.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
was sorry to my very heart to tell you what I did; I did not want help;
all that is past.&nbsp; But I wanted to know if you thought that a person
situated as I was, was justified in marrying any one ignorant of what
might happen, what I do hope and trust never will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I don&rsquo;t know what you are alluding to in this
mysterious way, you must see&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see, love?&mdash;I
am in the position of the ignorant man whom I think you said you could
not feel it right to marry.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you tell me straight
out what it is?&rdquo;&nbsp; He could not help his irritation betraying
itself in his tones and manner of speaking.&nbsp; She bent a little
forward, and looked full into his face, as though to pierce to the very
heart&rsquo;s truth of him.&nbsp; Then she said, as quietly as she had
ever spoken in her life,&mdash;&ldquo;You wish to break off our engagement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reddened and grew indignant in a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;What nonsense!&nbsp;
Just because I ask a question and make a remark!&nbsp; I think your
illness must have made you fanciful, Ellinor.&nbsp; Surely nothing I
said deserves such an interpretation.&nbsp; On the contrary, have I
not shown the sincerity and depth of my affection to you by clinging
to you through&mdash;through everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was going to say &ldquo;through the wearying opposition of my
family,&rdquo; but he stopped short, for he knew that the very fact
of his mother&rsquo;s opposition had only made him the more determined
to have his own way in the first instance; and even now he did not intend
to let out, what he had concealed up to this time, that his friends
all regretted his imprudent engagement.</p>
<p>Ellinor sat silently gazing out upon the meadows, but seeing nothing.&nbsp;
Then she put her hand into his.&nbsp; &ldquo;I quite trust you, Ralph.&nbsp;
I was wrong to doubt.&nbsp; I am afraid I have grown fanciful and silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was rather put to it for the right words, for she had precisely
divined the dim thought that had overshadowed his mind when she had
looked so intently at him.&nbsp; But he caressed her, and reassured
her with fond words, as incoherent as lovers&rsquo; words generally
are.</p>
<p>By-and-by they sauntered homewards.&nbsp; When they reached the house,
Ellinor left him, and flew up to see how her father was.&nbsp; When
Ralph went into his own room he was vexed with himself, both for what
he had said and for what he had not said.&nbsp; His mental look-out
was not satisfactory.</p>
<p>Neither he nor Mr. Wilkins was in good humour with the world in general
at dinner-time, and it needs little in such cases to condense and turn
the lowering tempers into one particular direction.&nbsp; As long as
Ellinor and Miss Monro stayed in the dining-room, a sort of moody peace
had been kept up, the ladies talking incessantly to each other about
the trivial nothings of their daily life, with an instinctive consciousness
that if they did not chatter on, something would be said by one of the
gentlemen which would be distasteful to the other.</p>
<p>As soon as Ralph had shut the door behind them, Mr. Wilkins went
to the sideboard, and took out a bottle which had not previously made
its appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a little cognac?&rdquo; he asked, with an assumption
of carelessness, as he poured out a wine-glassful.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a capital thing for the headache; and this nasty lowering weather has
given me a racking headache all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for it,&rdquo; said Ralph, &ldquo;for I wanted
particularly to speak to you about business&mdash;about my marriage,
in fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! speak away, I&rsquo;m as clear-headed as any man, if
that&rsquo;s what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph bowed, a little contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I wanted to say was, that I am anxious to have all things
arranged for my marriage in August.&nbsp; Ellinor is so much better
now; in fact, so strong, that I think we may reckon upon her standing
the change to a London life pretty well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wilkins stared at him rather blankly, but did not immediately
speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I may have the deeds drawn up in which, as by previous
arrangement, you advance a certain portion of Ellinor&rsquo;s fortune
for the purposes therein to be assigned; as we settled last year when
I hoped to have been married in August?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thought flitted through Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s confused brain that
he should find it impossible to produce the thousands required without
having recourse to the money lenders, who were already making difficulties,
and charging him usurious interest for the advances they had lately
made; and he unwisely tried to obtain a diminution in the sum he had
originally proposed to give Ellinor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Unwisely,&rdquo; because
he might have read Ralph&rsquo;s character better than to suppose he
would easily consent to any diminution without good and sufficient reason
being given; or without some promise of compensating advantages in the
future for the present sacrifice asked from him.&nbsp; But perhaps Mr.
Wilkins, dulled as he was by wine thought he could allege a good and
sufficient reason, for he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not be hard upon me, Ralph.&nbsp; That promise was
made before&mdash;before I exactly knew the state of my affairs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before Dunster&rsquo;s disappearance, in fact,&rdquo; said
Mr. Corbet, fixing his steady, penetrating eyes on Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s
countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;exactly&mdash;before Dunster&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
mumbled out Mr. Wilkins, red and confused, and not finishing his sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Ralph (for with careful carelessness
of manner he thought he could extract something of the real nature of
the impending disgrace from his companion, in the state in which he
then was; and if he only knew more about this danger he could guard
against it; guard others; perhaps himself)&mdash;&ldquo;By the way,
have you ever heard anything of Dunster since he went off to&mdash;America,
isn&rsquo;t it thought?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was startled beyond his power of self-control by the instantaneous
change in Mr. Wilkins which his question produced.&nbsp; Both started
up; Mr. Wilkins white, shaking, and trying to say something, but unable
to form a sensible sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God! sir, what is the matter?&rdquo; said Ralph, alarmed
at these signs of physical suffering.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilkins sat down, and repelled his nearer approach without speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nothing, only this headache which shoots through me
at times.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t look at me, sir, in that way.&nbsp; It is
very unpleasant to find another man&rsquo;s eyes perpetually fixed upon
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Ralph, coldly; his short-lived
sympathy, thus repulsed, giving way to his curiosity.&nbsp; But he waited
for a minute or two without daring to renew the conversation at the
point where they had stopped: whether interrupted by bodily or mental
discomfort on the part of his companion he was not quite sure.&nbsp;
While he hesitated how to begin again on the subject, Mr. Wilkins pulled
the bottle of brandy to himself and filled his glass again, tossing
off the spirit as if it had been water.&nbsp; Then he tried to look
Mr. Corbet full in the face, with a stare as pertinacious as he could
make it, but very different from the keen observant gaze which was trying
to read him through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were we talking about?&rdquo; said Ralph, at length,
with the most natural air in the world, just as if he had really been
forgetful of some half-discussed subject of interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what you&rsquo;d a d---d deal better hold your tongue about,&rdquo;
growled out Mr. Wilkins, in a surly thick voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said Ralph, starting to his feet with real passion
at being so addressed by &ldquo;Wilkins the attorney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued the latter, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll manage
my own affairs, and allow of no meddling and no questioning.&nbsp; I
said so once before, and I was not minded and bad came of it; and now
I say it again.&nbsp; And if you&rsquo;re to come here and put impertinent
questions, and stare at me as you&rsquo;ve been doing this half-hour
past, why, the sooner you leave this house the better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph half turned to take him at his word, and go at once; but then
he &ldquo;gave Ellinor another chance,&rdquo; as he worded it in his
thoughts; but it was in no spirit of conciliation that he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve taken too much of that stuff, sir.&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re saying.&nbsp; If you did, I should
leave your house at once, never to return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think so, do you?&rdquo; said Mr. Wilkins, trying to stand
up, and look dignified and sober.&nbsp; &ldquo;I say, sir, that if you
ever venture again to talk and look as you have done to-night, why,
sir, I will ring the bell and have you shown the door by my servants.&nbsp;
So now you&rsquo;re warned, my fine fellow!&rdquo;&nbsp; He sat down,
laughing a foolish tipsy laugh of triumph.&nbsp; In another minute his
arm was held firmly but gently by Ralph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Mr. Wilkins,&rdquo; he said, in a low hoarse voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You shall never have to say to me twice what you have said to-night.&nbsp;
Henceforward we are as strangers to each other.&nbsp; As to Ellinor&rdquo;&mdash;his
tones softened a little, and he sighed in spite of himself&mdash;&ldquo;I
do not think we should have been happy.&nbsp; I believe our engagement
was formed when we were too young to know our own minds, but I would
have done my duty and kept to my word; but you, sir, have yourself severed
the connection between us by your insolence to-night.&nbsp; I, to be
turned out of your house by your servants!&mdash;I, a Corbet of Westley,
who would not submit to such threats from a peer of the realm, let him
be ever so drunk!&rdquo;&nbsp; He was out of the room, almost out of
the house, before he had spoken the last words.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilkins sat still, first fiercely angry, then astonished, and
lastly dismayed into sobriety.&nbsp; &ldquo;Corbet, Corbet!&nbsp; Ralph!&rdquo;
he called in vain; then he got up and went to the door, opened it, looked
into the fully-lighted hall; all was so quiet there that he could hear
the quiet voices of the women in the drawing-room talking together.&nbsp;
He thought for a moment, went to the hat-stand, and missed Ralph&rsquo;s
low-crowned straw hat.</p>
<p>Then he sat down once more in the dining-room, and endeavoured to
make out exactly what had passed; but he could not believe that Mr.
Corbet had come to any enduring or final resolution to break off his
engagement, and he had almost reasoned himself back into his former
state of indignation at impertinence and injury, when Ellinor came in,
pale, hurried, and anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa! what does this mean?&rdquo; said she, putting an open
note into his hand.&nbsp; He took up his glasses, but his hand shook
so that he could hardly read.&nbsp; The note was from the Parsonage,
to Ellinor; only three lines sent by Mr. Ness&rsquo;s servant, who had
come to fetch Mr. Corbet&rsquo;s things.&nbsp; He had written three
lines with some consideration for Ellinor, even when he was in his first
flush of anger against her father, and it must be confessed of relief
at his own freedom, thus brought about by the act of another, and not
of his own working out, which partly saved his conscience.&nbsp; The
note ran thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;DEAR ELLINOR,&mdash;Words have passed between
your father and me which have obliged me to leave his house, I fear,
never to return to it.&nbsp; I will write more fully to-morrow.&nbsp;
But do not grieve too much, for I am not, and never have been, good
enough for you.&nbsp; God bless you, my dearest Nelly, though I call
you so for the last time.&mdash;R. C.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, what is it?&rdquo; Ellinor cried, clasping her hands
together, as her father sat silent, vacantly gazing into the fire, after
finishing the note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; said he, looking up at her piteously;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s the world, I think.&nbsp; Everything goes wrong with
me and mine: it went wrong before THAT night&mdash;so it can&rsquo;t
be that, can it, Ellinor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, papa!&rdquo; said she, kneeling down by him, her face
hidden on his breast.</p>
<p>He put one arm languidly round her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I used to read of
Orestes and the Furies at Eton when I was a boy, and I thought it was
all a heathen fiction.&nbsp; Poor little motherless girl!&rdquo; said
he, laying his other hand on her head, with the caressing gesture he
had been accustomed to use when she had been a little child.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did
you love him so very dearly, Nelly?&rdquo; he whispered, his cheek against
her: &ldquo;for somehow of late he has not seemed to me good enough
for thee.&nbsp; He has got an inkling that something has gone wrong,
and he was very inquisitive&mdash;I may say he questioned me in a relentless
kind of way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, papa, it was my doing, I&rsquo;m afraid.&nbsp; I said
something long ago about possible disgrace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pushed her away; he stood up, and looked at her with the eyes
dilated, half in fear, half in fierceness, of an animal at bay; he did
not heed that his abrupt movement had almost thrown her prostrate on
the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Ellinor!&nbsp; You&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, darling father, listen!&rdquo; said she, creeping to his
knees, and clasping them with her hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;I said it, as
if it were a possible case, of some one else&mdash;last August&mdash;but
he immediately applied it, and asked me if it was over me the disgrace,
or shame&mdash;I forget the words we used&mdash;hung; and what could
I say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything&mdash;anything to put him off the scent.&nbsp; God
help me, I am a lost man, betrayed by my child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellinor let go his knees, and covered her face.&nbsp; Every one stabbed
at that poor heart.&nbsp; In a minute or so her father spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean what I say.&nbsp; I often don&rsquo;t mean
it now.&nbsp; Ellinor, you must forgive me, my child!&rdquo;&nbsp; He
stooped, and lifted her up, and sat down, taking her on his knee, and
smoothing her hair off her hot forehead.&nbsp; &ldquo;Remember, child,
how very miserable I am, and have forgiveness for me.&nbsp; He had none,
and yet he must have seen I had been drinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drinking, papa!&rdquo; said Ellinor, raising her head, and
looking at him with sorrowful surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I drink now to try and forget,&rdquo; said he,
blushing and confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how miserable we are!&rdquo; cried Ellinor, bursting into
tears&mdash;&ldquo;how very miserable!&nbsp; It seems almost as if God
had forgotten to comfort us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! hush!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your mother said
once she did so pray that you might grow up religious; you must be religious,
child, because she prayed for it so often.&nbsp; Poor Lettice, how glad
I am that you are dead!&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he began to cry like a child.&nbsp;
Ellinor comforted him with kisses rather than words.&nbsp; He pushed
her away, after a while, and said, sharply: &ldquo;How much does he
know?&nbsp; I must make sure of that.&nbsp; How much did you tell him,
Ellinor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;nothing, indeed, papa, but what I told you just
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell it me again&mdash;the exact words!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, as well as I can; but it was last August.&nbsp; I
only said, &lsquo;Was it right for a woman to marry, knowing that disgrace
hung over her, and keeping her lover in ignorance of it?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was all, you are sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; He immediately applied the case to me&mdash;to
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he never wanted to know what was the nature of the threatened
disgrace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you told him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not a word more.&nbsp; He referred to the subject again
to-day, in the shrubbery; but I told him nothing more.&nbsp; You quite
believe me, don&rsquo;t you, papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pressed her to him, but did not speak.&nbsp; Then he took the
note up again, and read it with as much care and attention as he could
collect in his agitated state of mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nelly,&rdquo; said he, at length, &ldquo;he says true; he
is not good enough for thee.&nbsp; He shrinks from the thought of the
disgrace.&nbsp; Thou must stand alone, and bear the sins of thy father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook so much as he said this, that Ellinor had to put any suffering
of her own on one side, and try to confine her thoughts to the necessity
of getting her father immediately up to bed.&nbsp; She sat by him till
he went to sleep, and she could leave him, and go to her own room, to
forgetfulness and rest, if she could find those priceless blessings.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p>Mr. Corbet was so well known at the Parsonage by the two old servants,
that he had no difficulty, on reaching it, after his departure from
Ford Bank, in having the spare bed-chamber made ready for him, late
as it was, and in the absence of the master, who had taken a little
holiday, now that Lent and Easter were over, for the purpose of fishing.&nbsp;
While his room was getting ready, Ralph sent for his clothes, and by
the same messenger he despatched the little note to Ellinor.&nbsp; But
there was the letter he had promised her in it still to be written;
and it was almost his night&rsquo;s employment to say enough, yet not
too much; for, as he expressed it to himself, he was half way over the
stream, and it would be folly to turn back, for he had given nearly
as much pain both to himself and Ellinor by this time as he should do
by making the separation final.&nbsp; Besides, after Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s
speeches that evening&mdash;but he was candid enough to acknowledge
that, bad and offensive as they had been, if they had stood alone they
might have been condoned.</p>
<p>His letter ran as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;DEAREST ELLINOR, for dearest you are, and I think
will ever be, my judgment has consented to a step which is giving me
great pain, greater than you will readily believe.&nbsp; I am convinced
that it is better that we should part; for circumstances have occurred
since we formed our engagement which, although I am unaware of their
exact nature, I can see weigh heavily upon you, and have materially
affected your father&rsquo;s behaviour.&nbsp; Nay, I think, after to-night,
I may almost say have entirely altered his feelings towards me.&nbsp;
What these circumstances are I am ignorant, any further than that I
know from your own admission, that they may lead to some future disgrace.&nbsp;
Now, it may be my fault, it may be in my temperament, to be anxious,
above all things earthly, to obtain and possess a high reputation.&nbsp;
I can only say that it is so, and leave you to blame me for my weakness
as much as you like.&nbsp; But anything that might come in between me
and this object would, I own, be ill tolerated by me; the very dread
of such an obstacle intervening would paralyse me.&nbsp; I should become
irritable, and, deep as my affection is, and always must be, towards
you, I could not promise you a happy, peaceful life.&nbsp; I should
be perpetually haunted by the idea of what might happen in the way of
discovery and shame.&nbsp; I am the more convinced of this from my observation
of your father&rsquo;s altered character&mdash;an alteration which I
trace back to the time when I conjecture that the secret affairs took
place to which you have alluded.&nbsp; In short, it is for your sake,
my dear Ellinor, even more than for my own, that I feel compelled to
affix a final meaning to the words which your father addressed to me
last night, when he desired me to leave his house for ever.&nbsp; God
bless you, my Ellinor, for the last time my Ellinor.&nbsp; Try to forget
as soon as you can the unfortunate tie which has bound you for a time
to one so unsuitable&mdash;I believe I ought to say so unworthy of you&mdash;as&mdash;RALPH
CORBET.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ellinor was making breakfast when this letter was given her.&nbsp;
According to the wont of the servants of the respective households of
the Parsonage and Ford Bank, the man asked if there was any answer.&nbsp;
It was only custom; for he had not been desired to do so.&nbsp; Ellinor
went to the window to read her letter; the man waiting all the time
respectfully for her reply.&nbsp; She went to the writing-table, and
wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is all right&mdash;quite right.&nbsp; I ought
to have thought of it all last August.&nbsp; I do not think you will
forget me easily, but I entreat you never at any future time to blame
yourself.&nbsp; I hope you will be happy and successful.&nbsp; I suppose
I must never write to you again: but I shall always pray for you.&nbsp;
Papa was very sorry last night for having spoken angrily to you.&nbsp;
You must forgive him&mdash;there is great need for forgiveness in this
world.&mdash;ELLINOR.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She kept putting down thought after thought, just to prolong the
last pleasure of writing to him.&nbsp; She sealed the note, and gave
it to the man.&nbsp; Then she sat down and waited for Miss Monro, who
had gone to bed on the previous night without awaiting Ellinor&rsquo;s
return from the dining-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am late, my dear,&rdquo; said Miss Monro, on coming down,
&ldquo;but I have a bad headache, and I knew you had a pleasant companion.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then, looking round, she perceived Ralph&rsquo;s absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Corbet not down yet!&rdquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp; And then
Ellinor had to tell her the outline of the facts so soon likely to be
made public; that Mr. Corbet and she had determined to break off their
engagement; and that Mr. Corbet had accordingly betaken himself to the
Parsonage; and that she did not expect him to return to Ford Bank.&nbsp;
Miss Monro&rsquo;s astonishment was unbounded.&nbsp; She kept going
over and over all the little circumstances she had noticed during the
last visit, only on yesterday, in fact, which she could not reconcile
with the notion that the two, apparently so much attached to each other
but a few hours before, were now to be for ever separated and estranged.&nbsp;
Ellinor sickened under the torture; which yet seemed like torture in
a dream, from which there must come an awakening and a relief.&nbsp;
She felt as if she could not hear any more; yet there was more to hear.&nbsp;
Her father, as it turned out, was very ill, and had been so all night
long; he had evidently had some kind of attack on the brain, whether
apoplectic or paralytic it was for the doctors to decide.&nbsp; In the
hurry and anxiety of this day of misery succeeding to misery, she almost
forgot to wonder whether Ralph were still at the Parsonage&mdash;still
in Hamley; it was not till the evening visit of the physician that she
learnt that he had been seen by Dr. Moore as he was taking his place
in the morning mail to London.&nbsp; Dr. Moore alluded to his name as
to a thought that would cheer and comfort the fragile girl during her
night-watch by her father&rsquo;s bedside.&nbsp; But Miss Monro stole
out after the doctor to warn him off the subject for the future, crying
bitterly over the forlorn position of her darling as she spoke&mdash;crying
as Ellinor had never yet been able to cry: though all the time, in the
pride of her sex, she was as endeavouring to persuade the doctor it
was entirely Ellinor&rsquo;s doing, and the wisest and best thing she
could have done, as he was not good enough for her, only a poor barrister
struggling for a livelihood.&nbsp; Like many other kind-hearted people,
she fell into the blunder of lowering the moral character of those whom
it is their greatest wish to exalt.&nbsp; But Dr. Moore knew Ellinor
too well to believe the whole of what Miss Monro said; she would never
act from interested motives, and was all the more likely to cling to
a man because he was down and unsuccessful.&nbsp; No! there had been
a lovers&rsquo; quarrel; and it could not have happened at a sadder
time.</p>
<p>Before the June roses were in full bloom, Mr. Wilkins was dead.&nbsp;
He had left his daughter to the guardianship of Mr. Ness by some will
made years ago; but Mr. Ness had caught a rheumatic fever with his Easter
fishings, and been unable to be moved home from the little Welsh inn
where he had been staying when he was taken ill.&nbsp; Since his last
attack, Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s mind had been much affected; he often talked
strangely and wildly; but he had rare intervals of quietness and full
possession of his senses.&nbsp; At one of these times he must have written
a half-finished pencil note, which his nurse found under his pillow
after his death, and brought to Ellinor.&nbsp; Through her tear-blinded
eyes she read the weak, faltering words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am very ill.&nbsp; I sometimes think I shall
never get better, so I wish to ask your pardon for what I said the night
before I was taken ill.&nbsp; I am afraid my anger made mischief between
you and Ellinor, but I think you will forgive a dying man.&nbsp; If
you will come back and let all be as it used to be, I will make any
apology you may require.&nbsp; If I go, she will be so very friendless;
and I have looked to you to care for her ever since you first&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then came some illegible and incoherent writing, ending with, &ldquo;From
my deathbed I adjure you to stand her friend; I will beg pardon on my
knees for anything&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there strength had failed; the paper and pencil had been laid
aside to be resumed at some time when the brain was clearer, the hand
stronger.&nbsp; Ellinor kissed the letter, reverently folded it up,
and laid it among her sacred treasures, by her mother&rsquo;s half-finished
sewing, and a little curl of her baby sister&rsquo;s golden hair.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson, who had been one of the trustees for Mrs. Wilkins&rsquo;s
marriage settlement, a respectable solicitor in the county town, and
Mr. Ness, had been appointed executors of his will, and guardians to
Ellinor.&nbsp; The will itself had been made several years before, when
he imagined himself the possessor of a handsome fortune, the bulk of
which he bequeathed to his only child.&nbsp; By her mother&rsquo;s marriage-settlement,
Ford Bank was held in trust for the children of the marriage; the trustees
being Sir Frank Holster and Mr. Johnson.&nbsp; There were legacies to
his executors; a small annuity to Miss Monro, with the expression of
a hope that it might be arranged for her to continue living with Ellinor
as long as the latter remained unmarried; all his servants were remembered,
Dixon especially, and most liberally.</p>
<p>What remained of the handsome fortune once possessed by the testator?&nbsp;
The executors asked in vain; there was nothing.&nbsp; They could hardly
make out what had become of it, in such utter confusion were all the
accounts, both personal and official.&nbsp; Mr. Johnson was hardly restrained
by his compassion for the orphan from throwing up the executorship in
disgust.&nbsp; Mr. Ness roused himself from his scholarlike abstraction
to labour at the examination of books, parchments, and papers, for Ellinor&rsquo;s
sake.&nbsp; Sir Frank Holster professed himself only a trustee for Ford
Bank.</p>
<p>Meanwhile she went on living at Ford Bank, quite unconscious of the
state of her father&rsquo;s affairs, but sunk into a deep, plaintive
melancholy, which affected her looks and the tones of her voice in such
a manner as to distress Miss Monro exceedingly.&nbsp; It was not that
the good lady did not quite acknowledge the great cause her pupil had
for grieving&mdash;deserted by her lover, her father dead&mdash;but
that she could not bear the outward signs of how much these sorrows
had told on Ellinor.&nbsp; Her love for the poor girl was infinitely
distressed by seeing the daily wasting away, the constant heavy depression
of spirits, and she grew impatient of the continual pain of sympathy.&nbsp;
If Miss Monro could have done something to relieve Ellinor of her woe,
she would have been less inclined to scold her for giving way to it.</p>
<p>The time came when Miss Monro could act; and after that, there was
no more irritation on her part.&nbsp; When all hope of Ellinor&rsquo;s
having anything beyond the house and grounds of Ford Bank was gone;
when it was proved that all the legacies bequeathed by Mr. Wilkins not
one farthing could ever be paid; when it came to be a question how far
the beautiful pictures and other objects of art in the house were not
legally the property of unsatisfied creditors, the state of her father&rsquo;s
affairs was communicated to Ellinor as delicately as Mr. Ness knew how.</p>
<p>She was drooping over her work&mdash;she always drooped now&mdash;and
she left off sewing to listen to him, leaning her head on the arm which
rested on the table.&nbsp; She did not speak when he had ended his statement.&nbsp;
She was silent for whole minutes afterwards; he went on speaking out
of very agitation and awkwardness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all the rascal Dunster&rsquo;s doing, I&rsquo;ve no
doubt,&rdquo; said he, trying to account for the entire loss of Mr.
Wilkins&rsquo;s fortune.</p>
<p>To his surprise she lifted up her white stony face, and said slowly
and faintly, but with almost solemn calmness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ness, you must never allow Mr. Dunster to be blamed for
this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Ellinor, there can be no doubt about it.&nbsp; Your
father himself always referred to the losses he had sustained by Dunster&rsquo;s
disappearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellinor covered her face with her hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;God forgive
us all,&rdquo; she said, and relapsed into the old unbearable silence.&nbsp;
Mr. Ness had undertaken to discuss her future plans with her, and he
was obliged to go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear child&mdash;I have known you since you were quite
a little girl, you know&mdash;we must try not to give way to feeling&rdquo;&mdash;he
himself was choking; she was quite quiet&mdash;&ldquo;but think what
is to be done.&nbsp; You will have the rent of this house, and we have
a very good offer for it&mdash;a tenant on lease of seven years at a
hundred and twenty pounds a year&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will never let this house,&rdquo; said she, standing up
suddenly, and as if defying him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not let Ford Bank!&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t understand
it&mdash;I can&rsquo;t have been clear&mdash;Ellinor, the rent of this
house is all you will have to live on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, I can&rsquo;t leave this house.&nbsp;
Oh, Mr. Ness, I can&rsquo;t leave this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child, you shall not be hurried&mdash;I know how hardly
all these things are coming upon you (and I wish I had never seen Corbet,
with all my heart I do!)&rdquo;&mdash;this was almost to himself, but
she must have heard it, for she quivered all over&mdash;&ldquo;but leave
this house you must.&nbsp; You must eat, and the rent of this house
must pay for your food; you must dress, and there is nothing but the
rent to clothe you.&nbsp; I will gladly have you to stay at the Parsonage
as long as ever you like; but, in fact, the negotiations with Mr. Osbaldistone,
the gentleman who offers to take the house, are nearly completed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my house!&rdquo; said Ellinor, fiercely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
know it is settled on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear.&nbsp; It is held in trust for you by Sir Frank
Holster and Mr. Johnson; you to receive all moneys and benefits accruing
from it&rdquo;&mdash;he spoke gently, for he almost thought her head
was turned&mdash;&ldquo;but you remember you are not of age, and Mr.
Johnson and I have full power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellinor sat down, helpless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me,&rdquo; she said, at length.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are
very kind, but you don&rsquo;t know all.&nbsp; I cannot stand any more
talking now,&rdquo; she added, faintly.</p>
<p>Mr. Ness bent over her and kissed her forehead, and withdrew without
another word.&nbsp; He went to Miss Monro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! and how did you find her?&rdquo; was her first inquiry,
after the usual greetings had passed between them.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
really quite sad to see how she gives way; I speak to her, and speak
to her, and tell her how she is neglecting all her duties, and it does
no good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has had to bear a still further sorrow to-day,&rdquo;
said Mr. Ness.&nbsp; &ldquo;On the part of Mr. Johnson and myself I
have a very painful duty to perform to you as well as to her.&nbsp;
Mr. Wilkins has died insolvent.&nbsp; I grieve to say there is no hope
of your ever receiving any of your annuity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Monro looked very blank.&nbsp; Many happy little visions faded
away in those few moments; then she roused up and said, &ldquo;I am
but forty; I have a good fifteen years of work in me left yet, thank
God.&nbsp; Insolvent!&nbsp; Do you mean he has left no money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a farthing.&nbsp; The creditors may be thankful if they
are fully paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Ellinor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellinor will have the rent of this house, which is hers by
right of her mother&rsquo;s settlement, to live on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much will that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One hundred and twenty pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Monro&rsquo;s lips went into a form prepared for whistling.&nbsp;
Mr. Ness continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is at present unwilling enough to leave this house, poor
girl.&nbsp; It is but natural; but she has no power in the matter, even
were there any other course open to her.&nbsp; I can only say how glad,
how honoured, I shall feel by as long a visit as you and she can be
prevailed upon to pay me at the Parsonage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Mr. Corbet?&rdquo; said Miss Monro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know.&nbsp; After breaking off his engagement he
wrote me a long letter, explanatory, as he called it; exculpatory, as
I termed it.&nbsp; I wrote back, curtly enough, saying that I regretted
the breaking-off of an intercourse which had always been very pleasant
to me, but that he must be aware that, with my intimacy with the family
at Ford Bank, it would be both awkward and unpleasant to all parties
if he and I remained on our previous footing.&nbsp; Who is that going
past the window?&nbsp; Ellinor riding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Monro went to the window.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes!&nbsp; I am thankful
to see her on horseback again.&nbsp; It was only this morning I advised
her to have a ride!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Dixon! he will suffer too; his legacy can no more be
paid than the others; and it is not many young ladies who will be as
content to have so old-fashioned a groom riding after them as Ellinor
seems to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as Mr. Ness had left, Miss Monro went to her desk and wrote
a long letter to some friends she had at the cathedral town of East
Chester, where she had spent some happy years of her former life.&nbsp;
Her thoughts had gone back to this time even while Mr. Ness had been
speaking; for it was there her father had lived, and it was after his
death that her cares in search of a subsistence had begun.&nbsp; But
the recollections of the peaceful years spent there were stronger than
the remembrance of the weeks of sorrow and care; and, while Ellinor&rsquo;s
marriage had seemed a probable event, she had made many a little plan
of returning to her native place, and obtaining what daily teaching
she could there meet with, and the friends to whom she was now writing
had promised her their aid.&nbsp; She thought that as Ellinor had to
leave Ford Bank, a home at a distance might be more agreeable to her,
and she went on to plan that they should live together, if possible,
on her earnings, and the small income that would be Ellinor&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Miss Monro loved her pupil so dearly, that, if her own pleasure only
were to be consulted, this projected life would be more agreeable to
her than if Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s legacy had set her in independence,
with Ellinor away from her, married, and with interests in which her
former governess had but little part.</p>
<p>As soon as Mr. Ness had left her, Ellinor rang the bell, and startled
the servant who answered it by her sudden sharp desire to have the horses
at the door as soon as possible, and to tell Dixon to be ready to go
out with her.</p>
<p>She felt that she must speak to him, and in her nervous state she
wanted to be out on the free broad common, where no one could notice
or remark their talk.&nbsp; It was long since she had ridden, and much
wonder was excited by the sudden movement in kitchen and stable-yard.&nbsp;
But Dixon went gravely about his work of preparation, saying nothing.</p>
<p>They rode pretty hard till they reached Monk&rsquo;s Heath, six or
seven miles away from Hamley.&nbsp; Ellinor had previously determined
that here she would talk over the plan Mr. Ness had proposed to her
with Dixon, and he seemed to understand her without any words passing
between them.&nbsp; When she reined in he rode up to her, and met the
gaze of her sad eyes with sympathetic, wistful silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dixon,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;they say I must leave Ford
Bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afeared on it, from all I&rsquo;ve heerd say i&rsquo;
the town since the master&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve heard&mdash;then you know&mdash;that papa
has left hardly any money&mdash;my poor dear Dixon, you won&rsquo;t
have your legacy, and I never thought of that before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never heed, never heed,&rdquo; said he, eagerly; &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t have touched it if it had been there, for the taking
it would ha&rsquo; seemed too like&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Blood-money,
he was going to say, but he stopped in time.&nbsp; She guessed the meaning,
though not the word he would have used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not that,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;his will was dated years
before.&nbsp; But oh, Dixon, what must I do?&nbsp; They will make me
leave Ford Bank, I see.&nbsp; I think the trustees have half let it
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll have the rent on&rsquo;t, I reckon?&rdquo;
asked he, anxiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve many a time heerd &rsquo;em
say as it was settled on the missus first, and then on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, it is not that; but you know, under the beech-tree&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; said he, heavily.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been
oftentimes on my mind, waking, and I think there&rsquo;s ne&rsquo;er
a night as I don&rsquo;t dream of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can I leave it!&rdquo; Ellinor cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
may do a hundred things&mdash;may dig up the shrubbery.&nbsp; Oh! Dixon,
I feel as if it was sure to be found out!&nbsp; Oh! Dixon, I cannot
bear any more blame on papa&mdash;it will kill me&mdash;and such a dreadful
thing, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dixon&rsquo;s face fell into the lines of habitual pain that it had
always assumed of late years whenever he was thinking or remembering
anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must ne&rsquo;er ha&rsquo; reason to speak ill of the
dead, that&rsquo;s for certain,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Wilkinses
have been respected in Hamley all my lifetime, and all my father&rsquo;s
before me, and&mdash;surely, missy, there&rsquo;s ways and means of
tying tenants up from alterations both in the house and out of it, and
I&rsquo;d beg the trustees, or whatever they&rsquo;s called, to be very
particular, if I was you, and not have a thing touched either in the
house, or the gardens, or the meadows, or the stables.&nbsp; I think,
wi&rsquo; a word from you, they&rsquo;d maybe keep me on i&rsquo; the
stables, and I could look after things a bit; and the Day o&rsquo; Judgment
will come at last, when all our secrets will be made known wi&rsquo;out
our having the trouble and the shame o&rsquo; telling &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m getting rayther tired o&rsquo; this world, Miss Ellinor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so,&rdquo; said Ellinor, tenderly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know how sad it is, but, oh! remember how I shall want a friend
when you&rsquo;re gone, to advise me as you have done to-day.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re not feeling ill, Dixon, are you?&rdquo; she continued,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m hearty enough, and likely for t&rsquo;
live.&nbsp; Father was eighty-one, and mother above the seventies, when
they died.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only my heart as is got to feel so heavy;
and as for that matter, so is yours, I&rsquo;ll be bound.&nbsp; And
it&rsquo;s a comfort to us both if we can serve him as is dead by any
care of ours, for he were such a bright handsome lad, with such a cheery
face, as never should ha&rsquo; known shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rode on without much more speaking.&nbsp; Ellinor was silently
planning for Dixon, and he, not caring to look forward to the future,
was bringing up before his fancy the time, thirty years ago, when he
had first entered the elder Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s service as stable-lad,
and pretty Molly, the scullery-maid, was his daily delight.&nbsp; Pretty
Molly lay buried in Hamley churchyard, and few living, except Dixon,
could have gone straight to her grave.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p>In a few days Miss Monro obtained a most satisfactory reply to her
letter of inquiries as to whether a daily governess could find employment
in East Chester.&nbsp; For once the application seemed to have come
just at the right time.&nbsp; The canons were most of them married men,
with young families; those at present in residence welcomed the idea
of such instruction as Miss Monro could offer for their children, and
could almost answer for their successors in office.&nbsp; This was a
great step gained.&nbsp; Miss Monro, the daughter of a precentor to
this very cathedral, had a secret unwillingness to being engaged as
a teacher by any wealthy tradesman there; but to be received into the
canons&rsquo; families, in almost any capacity, was like going home.&nbsp;
Moreover, besides the empty honour of the thing, there were many small
pieces of patronage in the gift of the Chapter&mdash;such as a small
house opening on to the Close, which had formerly belonged to the verger,
but which was now vacant, and was offered to Miss Monro at a nominal
rent.</p>
<p>Ellinor had once more sunk into her old depressed passive state;
Mr. Ness and Miss Monro, modest and undecided as they both were in general,
had to fix and arrange everything for her.&nbsp; Her great interest
seemed to be in the old servant Dixon, and her great pleasure to lie
in seeing him, and talking over old times; so her two friends talked
about her, little knowing what a bitter, stinging pain her &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo;
was.&nbsp; In vain Ellinor tried to plan how they could take Dixon with
them to East Chester.&nbsp; If he had been a woman it would have been
a feasible step; but they were only to keep one servant, and Dixon,
capable and versatile as he was, would not do for that servant.&nbsp;
All this was what passed through Ellinor&rsquo;s mind: it is still a
question whether Dixon would have felt his love of his native place,
with all its associations and remembrances, or his love for Ellinor,
the stronger.&nbsp; But he was not put to the proof; he was only told
that he must leave, and seeing Ellinor&rsquo;s extreme grief at the
idea of their separation, he set himself to comfort her by every means
in his power, reminding her, with tender choice of words, how necessary
it was that he should remain on the spot, in Mr. Osbaldistone&rsquo;s
service, in order to frustrate, by any small influence he might have,
every project of alteration in the garden that contained the dreadful
secret.&nbsp; He persisted in this view, though Ellinor repeated, with
pertinacious anxiety, the care which Mr. Johnson had taken, in drawing
up the lease, to provide against any change or alteration being made
in the present disposition of the house or grounds.</p>
<p>People in general were rather astonished at the eagerness Miss Wilkins
showed to sell all the Ford Bank furniture.&nbsp; Even Miss Monro was
a little scandalized at this want of sentiment, although she said nothing
about it; indeed justified the step, by telling every one how wisely
Ellinor was acting, as the large, handsome, tables and chairs would
be very much out of place and keeping with the small, oddly-shaped rooms
of their future home in East Chester Close.&nbsp; None knew how strong
was the instinct of self-preservation, it may almost be called, which
impelled Ellinor to shake off, at any cost of present pain, the incubus
of a terrible remembrance.&nbsp; She wanted to go into an unhaunted
dwelling in a free, unknown country&mdash;she felt as if it was her
only chance of sanity.&nbsp; Sometimes she thought her senses would
not hold together till the time when all these arrangements were ended.&nbsp;
But she did not speak to any one about her feelings, poor child; to
whom could she speak on the subject but to Dixon?&nbsp; Nor did she
define them to herself.&nbsp; All she knew was, that she was as nearly
going mad as possible; and if she did, she feared that she might betray
her father&rsquo;s guilt.&nbsp; All this time she never cried, or varied
from her dull, passive demeanour.&nbsp; And they were blessed tears
of relief that she shed when Miss Monro, herself weeping bitterly, told
her to put her head out of the post-chaise window, for at the next turning
of the road they would catch the last glimpse of Hamley church spire.</p>
<p>Late one October evening, Ellinor had her first sight of East Chester
Close, where she was to pass the remainder of her life.&nbsp; Miss Monro
had been backwards and forwards between Hamley and East Chester more
than once, while Ellinor remained at the parsonage; so she had not only
the pride of proprietorship in the whole of the beautiful city, but
something of the desire of hospitably welcoming Ellinor to their joint
future home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! the fly must take us a long round, because of our luggage;
but behind these high old walls are the canons&rsquo; gardens.&nbsp;
That high-pitched roof, with the clumps of stonecrop on the walls near
it, is Canon Wilson&rsquo;s, whose four little girls I am to teach.&nbsp;
Hark! the great cathedral clock.&nbsp; How proud I used to be of its
great boom when I was a child!&nbsp; I thought all the other church
clocks in the town sounded so shrill and poor after that, which I considered
mine especially.&nbsp; There are rooks flying home to the elms in the
Close.&nbsp; I wonder if they are the same that used to be there when
I was a girl.&nbsp; They say the rook is a very long-lived bird, and
I feel as if I could swear to the way they are cawing.&nbsp; Ay, you
may smile, Ellinor, but I understand now those lines of Gray&rsquo;s
you used to say so prettily&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I feel the gales that from ye blow.<br />
A momentary bliss bestow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And breathe a second spring.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, dear, you must get out.&nbsp; This flagged walk leads to our
front-door; but our back rooms, which are the pleasantest, look on to
the Close, and the cathedral, and the lime-tree walk, and the deanery,
and the rookery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a mere slip of a house; the kitchen being wisely placed close
to the front-door, and so reserving the pretty view for the little dining-room,
out of which a glass-door opened into a small walled-in garden, which
had again an entrance into the Close.&nbsp; Upstairs was a bedroom to
the front, which Miss Monro had taken for herself, because as she said,
she had old associations with the back of every house in the High-street,
while Ellinor mounted to the pleasant chamber above the tiny drawing-room
both of which looked on to the vast and solemn cathedral, and the peaceful
dignified Close.&nbsp; East Chester Cathedral is Norman, with a low,
massive tower, a grand, majestic nave, and a choir full of stately historic
tombs.&nbsp; The whole city is so quiet and decorous a place, that the
perpetual daily chants and hymns of praise seemed to sound far and wide
over the roofs of the houses.&nbsp; Ellinor soon became a regular attendant
at all the morning and evening services.&nbsp; The sense of worship
calmed and soothed her aching weary heart, and to be punctual to the
cathedral hours she roused and exerted herself, when probably nothing
else would have been sufficient to this end.</p>
<p>By-and-by Miss Monro formed many acquaintances; she picked up, or
was picked up by, old friends, and the descendants of old friends.&nbsp;
The grave and kindly canons, whose children she taught, called upon
her with their wives, and talked over the former deans and chapters,
of whom she had both a personal and traditional knowledge, and as they
walked away and talked about her silent delicate-looking friend Miss
Wilkins, and perhaps planned some little present out of their fruitful
garden or bounteous stores, which should make Miss Monro&rsquo;s table
a little more tempting to one apparently so frail as Ellinor, for the
household was always spoken of as belonging to Miss Monro, the active
and prominent person.&nbsp; By-and-by, Ellinor herself won her way to
their hearts, not by words or deeds, but by her sweet looks and meek
demeanour, as they marked her regular attendance at cathedral service:
and when they heard of her constant visits to a certain parochial school,
and of her being sometimes seen carrying a little covered basin to the
cottages of the poor, they began to try and tempt her, with more urgent
words, to accompany Miss Monro in her frequent tea-drinkings at their
houses.&nbsp; The old dean, that courteous gentleman and good Christian,
had early become great friends with Ellinor.&nbsp; He would watch at
the windows of his great vaulted library till he saw her emerge from
the garden into the Close, and then open the deanery door, and join
her, she softly adjusting the measure of her pace to his.&nbsp; The
time of his departure from East Chester became a great blank in her
life, although she would never accept, or allow Miss Monro to accept,
his repeated invitations to go and pay him a visit at his country-place.&nbsp;
Indeed, having once tasted comparative peace again in East Chester Cathedral
Close, it seemed as though she was afraid of ever venturing out of those
calm precincts.&nbsp; All Mr. Ness&rsquo;s invitations to visit him
at his parsonage at Hamley were declined, although he was welcomed at
Miss Monro&rsquo;s, on the occasion of his annual visit, by every means
in their power.&nbsp; He slept at one of the canon&rsquo;s vacant houses,
and lived with his two friends, who made a yearly festivity, to the
best of their means, in his honour, inviting such of the cathedral clergy
as were in residence: or, if they failed, condescending to the town
clergy.&nbsp; Their friends knew well that no presents were so acceptable
as those sent while Mr. Ness was with them; and from the dean, who would
send them a hamper of choice fruit and flowers from Oxton Park, down
to the curate, who worked in the same schools as Ellinor, and who was
a great fisher, and caught splendid trout&mdash;all did their best to
help them to give a welcome to the only visitor they ever had.&nbsp;
The only visitor they ever had, as far as the stately gentry knew.&nbsp;
There was one, however, who came as often as his master could give him
a holiday long enough to undertake a journey to so distant a place;
but few knew of his being a guest at Miss Monro&rsquo;s, though his
welcome there was not less hearty than Mr. Ness&rsquo;s&mdash;this was
Dixon.&nbsp; Ellinor had convinced him that he could give her no greater
pleasure at any time than by allowing her to frank him to and from East
Chester.&nbsp; Whenever he came they were together the greater part
of the day; she taking him hither and thither to see all the sights
that she thought would interest or please him; but they spoke very little
to each other during all this companionship.&nbsp; Miss Monro had much
more to say to him.&nbsp; She questioned him right and left whenever
Ellinor was out of the room.&nbsp; She learnt that the house at Ford
Bank was splendidly furnished, and no money spared on the garden; that
the eldest Miss Hanbury was very well married; that Brown had succeeded
to Jones in the haberdasher&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; Then she hesitated a
little before making her next inquiry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose Mr. Corbet never comes to the Parsonage now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not he.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think as how Mr. Ness would
have him; but they write letters to each other by times.&nbsp; Old Job&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
recollect old Job, ma&rsquo;am, he that gardened for Mr Ness, and waited
in the parlour when there was company&mdash;did say as one day he heerd
them speaking about Mr. Corbet; and he&rsquo;s a grand counsellor now&mdash;one
of them as goes about at assize-time, and speaks in a wig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A barrister, you mean,&rdquo; said Miss Monro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay; and he&rsquo;s something more than that, though I can&rsquo;t
rightly remember what,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellinor could have told them both.&nbsp; They had <i>The Times</i>
lent to them on the second day after publication by one of their friends
in the Close, and Ellinor, watching till Miss Monro&rsquo;s eyes were
otherwise engaged, always turned with trembling hands and a beating
heart to the reports of the various courts of law.&nbsp; In them she
found&mdash;at first rarely&mdash;the name she sought for, the name
she dwelt upon, as if every letter were a study.&nbsp; Mr. Losh and
Mr. Duncombe appeared for the plaintiff, Mr. Smythe and Mr. Corbet for
the defendant.&nbsp; In a year or two that name appeared more frequently,
and generally took the precedence of the other, whatever it might be;
then on special occasions his speeches were reported at full length,
as if his words were accounted weighty; and by-and-by she saw that he
had been appointed a Queen&rsquo;s counsel.&nbsp; And this was all she
ever heard or saw about him; his once familiar name never passed her
lips except in hurried whispers to Dixon, when he came to stay with
them.&nbsp; Ellinor had had no idea when she parted from Mr. Corbet
how total the separation between them was henceforward to be, so much
seemed left unfinished, unexplained.&nbsp; It was so difficult, at first,
to break herself of the habit of constant mental reference to him; and
for many a long year she kept thinking that surely some kind fortune
would bring them together again, and all this heart-sickness and melancholy
estrangement from each other would then seem to both only as an ugly
dream that had passed away in the morning light.</p>
<p>The dean was an old man, but there was a canon who was older still,
and whose death had been expected by many, and speculated upon by some,
any time for ten years at least.&nbsp; Canon Holdsworth was too old
to show active kindness to any one; the good dean&rsquo;s life was full
of thoughtful and benevolent deeds.&nbsp; But he was taken, and the
other left.&nbsp; Ellinor looked out at the vacant deanery with tearful
eyes, the last thing at night, the first in the morning.&nbsp; But it
is pretty nearly the same with church dignitaries as with kings; the
dean is dead, long live the dean!&nbsp; A clergyman from a distant county
was appointed, and all the Close was astir to learn and hear every particular
connected with him.&nbsp; Luckily he came in at the tag-end of one of
the noble families in the peerage; so, at any rate, all his future associates
could learn with tolerable certainty that he was forty-two years of
age, married, and with eight daughters and one son.&nbsp; The deanery,
formerly so quiet and sedate a dwelling of the one old man, was now
to be filled with noise and merriment.&nbsp; Iron railings were being
placed before three windows, evidently to be the nursery.&nbsp; In the
summer publicity of open windows and doors, the sound of the busy carpenters
was perpetually heard all over the Close: and by-and-by waggon-loads
of furniture and carriage-loads of people began to arrive.&nbsp; Neither
Miss Monro nor Ellinor felt themselves of sufficient importance or station
to call on the new comers, but they were as well acquainted with the
proceedings of the family as if they had been in daily intercourse;
they knew that the eldest Miss Beauchamp was seventeen, and very pretty,
only one shoulder was higher than the other; that she was dotingly fond
of dancing, and talked a great deal in a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>,
but not much if her mamma was by, and never opened her lips at all if
the dean was in the room; that the next sister was wonderfully clever,
and was supposed to know all the governess could teach her, and to have
private lessons in Greek and mathematics from her father; and so on
down to the little boy at the preparatory school and the baby-girl in
arms.&nbsp; Moreover, Miss Monro, at any rate, could have stood an examination
as to the number of servants at the deanery, their division of work,
and the hours of their meals.&nbsp; Presently, a very beautiful, haughty-looking
young lady made her appearance in the Close, and in the dean&rsquo;s
pew.&nbsp; She was said to be his niece, the orphan daughter of his
brother, General Beauchamp, come to East Chester to reside for the necessary
time before her marriage, which was to be performed in the cathedral
by her uncle, the new dignitary.&nbsp; But as callers at the deanery
did not see this beautiful bride elect, and as the Beauchamps had not
as yet fallen into habits of intimacy with any of their new acquaintances,
very little was known of the circumstances of this approaching wedding
beyond the particulars given above.</p>
<p>Ellinor and Miss Monro sat at their drawing-room window, a little
shaded by the muslin curtains, watching the busy preparations for the
marriage, which was to take place the next day.&nbsp; All morning long,
hampers of fruit and flowers, boxes from the railway&mdash;for by this
time East Chester had got a railway&mdash;shop messengers, hired assistants,
kept passing backwards and forwards in the busy Close.&nbsp; Towards
afternoon the bustle subsided, the scaffolding was up, the materials
for the next day&rsquo;s feast carried out of sight.&nbsp; It was to
be concluded that the bride elect was seeing to the packing of her trousseau,
helped by the merry multitude of cousins, and that the servants were
arranging the dinner for the day, or the breakfast for the morrow.&nbsp;
So Miss Monro had settled it, discussing every detail and every probability
as though she were a chief actor, instead of only a distant, uncared-for
spectator of the coming event.&nbsp; Ellinor was tired, and now that
there was nothing interesting going on, she had fallen back to her sewing,
when she was startled by Miss Memo&rsquo;s exclamation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, look! here are two gentlemen coming along the lime-tree
walk! it must be the bridegroom and his friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; Out of
much sympathy, and some curiosity, Ellinor bent forward, and saw, just
emerging from the shadow of the trees on to the full afternoon sunlit
pavement, Mr. Corbet and another gentleman; the former changed, worn,
aged, though with still the same fine intellectual face, leaning on
the arm of the younger taller man, and talking eagerly.&nbsp; The other
gentleman was doubtless the bridegroom, Ellinor said to herself; and
yet her prophetic heart did not believe her words.&nbsp; Even before
the bright beauty at the deanery looked out of the great oriel window
of the drawing-room, and blushed, and smiled, and kissed her hand&mdash;a
gesture replied to by Mr. Corbet with much <i>empressement</i>, while
the other man only took off his hat, almost as if he saw her there for
the first time&mdash;Ellinor&rsquo;s greedy eyes watched him till he
was hidden from sight in the deanery, unheeding Miss Monro&rsquo;s eager
incoherent sentences, in turn entreating, apologising, comforting, and
upbraiding.&nbsp; Then she slowly turned her painful eyes upon Miss
Monro&rsquo;s face, and moved her lips without a sound being heard,
and fainted dead away.&nbsp; In all her life she had never done so before,
and when she came round she was not like herself; in all probability
the persistence and wilfulness she, who was usually so meek and docile,
showed during the next twenty-four hours, was the consequence of fever.&nbsp;
She resolved to be present at the wedding; numbers were going; she would
be unseen, unnoticed in the crowd; but whatever befell, go she would,
and neither the tears nor the prayers of Miss Monro could keep her back.&nbsp;
She gave no reason for this determination; indeed, in all probability
she had none to give; so there was no arguing the point.&nbsp; She was
inflexible to entreaty, and no one had any authority over her, except,
perhaps, distant Mr. Ness.&nbsp; Miss Monro had all sorts of forebodings
as to the possible scenes that might come to pass.&nbsp; But all went
on as quietly as though the fullest sympathy pervaded every individual
of the great numbers assembled.&nbsp; No one guessed that the muffled,
veiled figure, sitting in the shadow behind one of the great pillars,
was that of one who had once hoped to stand at the altar with the same
bridegroom, who now cast tender looks at the beautiful bride; her veil
white and fairy-like, Ellinor&rsquo;s black and shrouding as that of
any nun.</p>
<p>Already Mr. Corbet&rsquo;s name was known through the country as
that of a great lawyer; people discussed his speeches and character
far and wide; and the well-informed in legal gossip spoke of him as
sure to be offered a judgeship at the next vacancy.&nbsp; So he, though
grave, and middle-aged, and somewhat grey, divided attention and remark
with his lovely bride, and her pretty train of cousin bridesmaids.&nbsp;
Miss Monro need not have feared for Ellinor: she saw and heard all things
as in a mist&mdash;a dream; as something she had to go through, before
she could waken up to a reality of brightness in which her youth, and
the hopes of her youth, should be restored, and all these weary years
of dreaminess and woe should be revealed as nothing but the nightmare
of a night.&nbsp; She sat motionless enough, still enough, Miss Monro
by her, watching her as intently as a keeper watches a madman, and with
the same purpose&mdash;to prevent any outburst even by bodily strength,
if such restraint be needed.&nbsp; When all was over; when the principal
personages of the ceremony had filed into the vestry to sign their names;
when the swarm of townspeople were going out as swiftly as their individual
notions of the restraints of the sacred edifice permitted; when the
great chords of the &ldquo;Wedding March&rdquo; clanged out from the
organ, and the loud bells pealed overhead&mdash;Ellinor laid her hand
in Miss Monro&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take me home,&rdquo; she said softly.&nbsp;
And Miss Monro led her home as one leads the blind.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p>There are some people who imperceptibly float away from their youth
into middle age, and thence pass into declining life with the soft and
gentle motion of happy years.&nbsp; There are others who are whirled,
in spite of themselves, down dizzy rapids of agony away from their youth
at one great bound, into old age with another sudden shock; and thence
into the vast calm ocean where there are no shore-marks to tell of time.</p>
<p>This last, it seemed, was to be Ellinor&rsquo;s lot.&nbsp; Her youth
had gone in a single night, fifteen years ago, and now she appeared
to have become an elderly woman; very still and hopeless in look and
movement, but as sweet and gentle in speech and smile as ever she had
been in her happiest days.&nbsp; All young people, when they came to
know her, loved her dearly, though at first they might call her dull,
and heavy to get on with; and as for children and old people, her ready
watchful sympathy in their joys as well as their sorrows was an unfailing
passage to their hearts.&nbsp; After the first great shock of Mr. Corbet&rsquo;s
marriage was over, she seemed to pass into a greater peace than she
had known for years; the last faint hope of happiness was gone; it would,
perhaps, be more accurate to say, of the bright happiness she had planned
for herself in her early youth.&nbsp; Unconsciously, she was being weaned
from self-seeking in any shape, and her daily life became, if possible,
more innocent and pure and holy.&nbsp; One of the canons used to laugh
at her for her constant attendance at all the services, and for her
devotion to good works, and call her always the reverend sister.&nbsp;
Miss Monro was a little annoyed at this faint clerical joke; Ellinor
smiled quietly.&nbsp; Miss Monro disapproved of Ellinor&rsquo;s grave
ways and sober severe style of dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be as good as you like, my dear, and yet go dressed
in some pretty colour, instead of those perpetual blacks and greys,
and then there would be no need for me to be perpetually telling people
you are only four-and-thirty (and they don&rsquo;t believe me, though
I tell them so till I am black in the face).&nbsp; Or, if you would
but wear a decent-shaped bonnet, instead of always wearing those of
the poky shape in fashion when you were seventeen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old canon died, and some one was to be appointed in his stead.&nbsp;
These clerical preferments and appointments were the all-important interests
to the inhabitants of the Close, and the discussion of probabilities
came up invariably if any two met together, in street or house, or even
in the very cathedral itself.&nbsp; At length it was settled, and announced
by the higher powers.&nbsp; An energetic, hard-working clergyman from
a distant part of the diocese, Livingstone by name, was to have the
vacant canonry.</p>
<p>Miss Monro said that the name was somehow familiar to her, and by
degrees she recollected the young curate who had come to inquire after
Ellinor in that dreadful illness she had had at Hamley in the year 1829.&nbsp;
Ellinor knew nothing of that visit; no more than Miss Monro did of what
had passed between the two before that anxious night.&nbsp; Ellinor
just thought it possible it might be the same Mr. Livingstone, and would
rather it were not, because she did not feel as if she could bear the
frequent though not intimate intercourse she must needs have, if such
were the case, with one so closely associated with that great time of
terror which she was striving to bury out of sight by every effort in
her power.&nbsp; Miss Monro, on the contrary, was busy weaving a romance
for her pupil; she thought of the passionate interest displayed by the
fair young clergyman fifteen years ago, and believed that occasionally
men could be constant, and hoped that if Mr. Livingstone were the new
canon, he might prove the <i>rara avis</i> which exists but once in
a century.&nbsp; He came, and it was the same.&nbsp; He looked a little
stouter, a little older, but had still the gait and aspect of a young
man.&nbsp; His smooth fair face was scarcely lined at all with any marks
of care; the blue eyes looked so kindly and peaceful, that Miss Monro
could scarcely fancy they were the same which she had seen fast filling
with tears; the bland calm look of the whole man needed the ennoblement
of his evident devoutness to be raised into the type of holy innocence
which some of the Romanists call the &ldquo;sacerdotal face.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His entire soul was in his work, and he looked as little likely to step
forth in the character of either a hero of romance or a faithful lover
as could be imagined.&nbsp; Still Miss Monro was not discouraged; she
remembered the warm, passionate feeling she had once seen break through
the calm exterior, and she believed that what had happened once might
occur again.</p>
<p>Of course, while all eyes were directed on the new canon, he had
to learn who the possessors of those eyes were one by one; and it was
probably some time before the idea came into his mind that Miss Wilkins,
the lady in black, with the sad pale face, so constant an attendant
at service, so regular a visitor at the school, was the same Miss Wilkins
as the bright vision of his youth.&nbsp; It was her sweet smile at a
painstaking child that betrayed her&mdash;if, indeed, betrayal it might
be called where there was no wish or effort to conceal anything.&nbsp;
Canon Livingstone left the schoolroom almost directly, and, after being
for an hour or so in his house, went out to call on Mrs. Randall, the
person who knew more of her neighbours&rsquo; affairs than any one in
East Chester.</p>
<p>The next day he called on Miss Wilkins herself.&nbsp; She would have
been very glad if he had kept on in his ignorance; it was so keenly
painful to be in the company of one the sight of whom, even at a distance,
had brought her such a keen remembrance of past misery; and when told
of his call, as she was sitting at her sewing in the dining-room, she
had to nerve herself for the interview before going upstairs into the
drawing-room, where he was being entertained by Miss Monro with warm
demonstrations of welcome.&nbsp; A little contraction of the brow, a
little compression of the lips, an increased pallor on Ellinor&rsquo;s
part, was all that Miss Monro could see in her, though she had put on
her glasses with foresight and intention to observe.&nbsp; She turned
to the canon; his colour had certainly deepened as he went forwards
with out-stretched hand to meet Ellinor.&nbsp; That was all that was
to be seen; but on the slight foundation of that blush, Miss Monro built
many castles; and when they faded away, one after one, she recognised
that they were only baseless visions.&nbsp; She used to put the disappointment
of her hopes down to Ellinor&rsquo;s unvaried calmness of demeanour,
which might be taken for coldness of disposition; and to her steady
refusal to allow Miss Monro to invite Canon Livingstone to the small
teas they were in the habit of occasionally giving.&nbsp; Yet he persevered
in his calls; about once every fortnight he came, and would sit an hour
or more, looking covertly at his watch, as if as Miss Monro shrewdly
observed to herself, he did not go away at last because he wished to
do so, but because he ought.&nbsp; Sometimes Ellinor was present, sometimes
she was away; in this latter case Miss Monro thought she could detect
a certain wistful watching of the door every time a noise was heard
outside the room.&nbsp; He always avoided any reference to former days
at Hamley, and that, Miss Monro feared, was a bad sign.</p>
<p>After this long uniformity of years without any event closely touching
on Ellinor&rsquo;s own individual life, with the one great exception
of Mr. Corbet&rsquo;s marriage, something happened which much affected
her.&nbsp; Mr. Ness died suddenly at his parsonage, and Ellinor learnt
it first from Mr. Brown, a clergyman, whose living was near Hamley,
and who had been sent for by the Parsonage servants as soon as they
discovered that it was not sleep, but death, that made their master
so late in rising.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown had been appointed executer by his late friend, and wrote
to tell Ellinor that after a few legacies were paid, she was to have
a life-interest in the remainder of the small property which Mr. Ness
had left, and that it would be necessary for her, as the residuary legatee,
to come to Hamley Parsonage as soon as convenient, to decide upon certain
courses of action with regard to furniture, books, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Ellinor shrank from this journey, which her love and duty towards
her dead friend rendered necessary.&nbsp; She had scarcely left East
Chester since she first arrived there, sixteen or seventeen years ago,
and she was timorous about the very mode of travelling; and then to
go back to Hamley, which she thought never to have seen again!&nbsp;
She never spoke much about any feelings of her own, but Miss Monro could
always read her silence, and interpreted it into pretty just and forcible
words that afternoon when Canon Livingstone called.&nbsp; She liked
to talk about Ellinor to him, and suspected that he liked to hear.&nbsp;
She was almost annoyed this time by the comfort he would keep giving
her; there was no greater danger in travelling by railroad than by coach,
a little care about certain things was required, that was all, and the
average number of deaths by accidents on railroads was not greater than
the average number when people travelled by coach, if you took into
consideration the far greater number of travellers.&nbsp; Yes! returning
to the deserted scenes of one&rsquo;s youth was very painful . . . Had
Miss Wilkins made any provision for another lady to take her place as
visitor at the school?&nbsp; He believed it was her week.&nbsp; Miss
Monro was out of all patience at his entire calmness and reasonableness.&nbsp;
Later in the day she became more at peace with him, when she received
a kind little note from Mrs. Forbes, a great friend of hers, and the
mother of the family she was now teaching, saying that Canon Livingstone
had called and told her that Ellinor had to go on a very painful journey,
and that Mrs. Forbes was quite sure Miss Monro&rsquo;s companionship
upon it would be a great comfort to both, and that she could perfectly
be set at liberty for a fortnight or so, for it would fall in admirably
with the fact that &ldquo;Jeanie was growing tall, and the doctor had
advised sea air this spring; so a month&rsquo;s holiday would suit them
now even better than later on.&rdquo;&nbsp; Was this going straight
to Mrs. Forbes, to whom she should herself scarcely have liked to name
it, the act of a good, thoughtful man, or of a lover? questioned Miss
Monro; but she could not answer her own inquiry, and had to be very
grateful for the deed, without accounting for the motives.</p>
<p>A coach met the train at a station about ten miles from Hamley, and
Dixon was at the inn where the coach stopped, ready to receive them.</p>
<p>The old man was almost in tears at the sight of them again in a familiar
place.&nbsp; He had put on his Sunday clothes to do them honour; and
to conceal his agitation he kept up a pretended bustle about their luggage.&nbsp;
To the indignation of the inn-porters, who were of a later generation,
he would wheel it himself to the Parsonage, though he broke down from
fatigue once or twice on the way, and had to stand and rest, his ladies
waiting by his side, and making remarks on the alterations of houses
and the places of trees, in order to give him ample time to recruit
himself, for there was no one to wait for them and give them a welcome
to the Parsonage, which was to be their temporary home.&nbsp; The respectful
servants, in deep mourning, had all prepared, and gave Ellinor a note
from Mr. Brown, saying that he purposely refrained from disturbing them
that day after their long journey, but would call on the morrow, and
tell them of the arrangements he had thought of making, always subject
to Miss Wilkins&rsquo;s approval.</p>
<p>These were simple enough; certain legal forms to be gone through,
any selection from books or furniture to be made, and the rest to be
sold by auction as speedily as convenient, as the successor to the living
might wish to have repairs and alterations effected in the old parsonage.&nbsp;
For some days Ellinor employed herself in business in the house, never
going out except to church.&nbsp; Miss Monro, on the contrary, strolled
about everywhere, noticing all the alterations in place and people,
which were never improvements in her opinion.&nbsp; Ellinor had plenty
of callers (her tenants, Mr. and Mrs. Osbaldistone among others), but,
excepting in rare cases&mdash;most of them belonged to humble life&mdash;she
declined to see every one, as she had business enough on her hands:
sixteen years makes a great difference in any set of people.&nbsp; The
old acquaintances of her father in his better days were almost all dead
or removed; there were one or two remaining, and these Ellinor received;
one or two more, old and infirm, confined to their houses, she planned
to call upon before leaving Hamley.&nbsp; Every evening, when Dixon
had done his work at Mr. Osbaldistone&rsquo;s, he came up to the Parsonage,
ostensibly to help her in moving or packing books, but really because
these two clung to each other&mdash;were bound to each other by a bond
never to be spoken about.&nbsp; It was understood between them that
once before Ellinor left she should go and see the old place, Ford Bank.&nbsp;
Not to go into the house, though Mr. and Mrs. Osbaldistone had begged
her to name her own time for revisiting it when they and their family
would be absent, but to see all the gardens and grounds once more; a
solemn, miserable visit, which, because of the very misery it involved,
appeared to Ellinor to be an imperative duty.</p>
<p>Dixon and she talked together as she sat making a catalogue one evening
in the old low-browed library; the casement windows were open into the
garden, and the May showers had brought out the scents of the new-leaved
sweetbriar bush just below.&nbsp; Beyond the garden hedge the grassy
meadows sloped away down to the river; the Parsonage was so much raised
that, sitting in the house, you could see over the boundary hedge.&nbsp;
Men with instruments were busy in the meadow.&nbsp; Ellinor, pausing
in her work, asked Dixon what they were doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them&rsquo;s the people for the new railway,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nought would satisfy the Hamley folk but to have a railway all
to themselves&mdash;coaches isn&rsquo;t good enough now-a-days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke with a tone of personal offence natural to a man who had
passed all his life among horses, and considered railway-engines as
their despicable rivals, conquering only by stratagem.</p>
<p>By-and-by Ellinor passed on to a subject the consideration of which
she had repeatedly urged upon Dixon, and entreated him to come and form
one of their household at East Chester.&nbsp; He was growing old, she
thought older even in looks and feelings than in years, and she would
make him happy and comfortable in his declining years if he would but
come and pass them under her care.&nbsp; The addition which Mr. Ness&rsquo;s
bequest made to her income would enable her to do not only this, but
to relieve Miss Monro of her occupation of teaching; which, at the years
she had arrived at, was becoming burdensome.&nbsp; When she proposed
the removal to Dixon he shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t thank you, and kindly, too;
but I&rsquo;m too old to go chopping and changing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it would be no change to come back to me, Dixon,&rdquo;
said Ellinor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it would.&nbsp; I were born i&rsquo; Hamley, and it&rsquo;s
i&rsquo; Hamley I reckon to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On her urging him a little more, it came out that he had a strong
feeling that if he did not watch the spot where the dead man lay buried,
the whole would be discovered; and that this dread of his had often
poisoned the pleasure of his visit to East Chester.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t rightly know how it is, for I sometimes think
if it wasn&rsquo;t for you, missy, I should be glad to have made it
all clear before I go; and yet at times I dream, or it comes into my
head as I lie awake with the rheumatics, that some one is there, digging;
or that I hear &rsquo;em cutting down the tree; and then I get up and
look out of the loft window&mdash;you&rsquo;ll mind the window over
the stables, as looks into the garden, all covered over wi&rsquo; the
leaves of the jargonelle pear-tree?&nbsp; That were my room when first
I come as stable-boy, and tho&rsquo; Mr. Osbaldistone would fain give
me a warmer one, I allays tell him I like th&rsquo; old place best.&nbsp;
And by times I&rsquo;ve getten up five or six times a-night to make
sure as there was no one at work under the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellinor shivered a little.&nbsp; He saw it, and restrained himself
in the relief he was receiving from imparting his superstitious fancies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, missy, I could never rest a-nights if I didn&rsquo;t
feel as if I kept the secret in my hand, and held it tight day and night,
so as I could open my hand at any minute and see as it was there.&nbsp;
No! my own little missy will let me come and see her now and again,
and I know as I can allays ask her for what I want: and if it please
God to lay me by, I shall tell her so, and she&rsquo;ll see as I want
for nothing.&nbsp; But somehow I could ne&rsquo;er bear leaving Hamley.&nbsp;
You shall come and follow me to my grave when my time comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so, please, Dixon,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, it&rsquo;ll be a mercy when I can lay me down and sleep
in peace: though I sometimes fear as peace will not come to me even
there.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was going out of the room, and was now more talking
to himself than to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;They say blood will out, and if
it weren&rsquo;t for her part in it, I could wish for a clear breast
before I die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not hear the latter part of this mumbled sentence.&nbsp;
She was looking at a letter just brought in and requiring an immediate
answer.&nbsp; It was from Mr. Brown.&nbsp; Notes from him were of daily
occurrence, but this contained an open letter the writing of which was
strangely familiar to her&mdash;it did not need the signature &ldquo;Ralph
Corbet,&rdquo; to tell her whom the letter came from.&nbsp; For some
moments she could not read the words.&nbsp; They expressed a simple
enough request, and were addressed to the auctioneer who was to dispose
of the rather valuable library of the late Mr. Ness, and whose name
had been advertised in connection with the sale, in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>,
and other similar papers.&nbsp; To him Mr. Corbet wrote, saying that
he should be unable to be present when the books were sold, but that
he wished to be allowed to buy in, at any price decided upon, a certain
rare folio edition of <i>Virgil</i>, bound in parchment, and with notes
in Italian.&nbsp; The book was fully described.&nbsp; Though no Latin
scholar, Ellinor knew the book well&mdash;remembered its look from old
times, and could instantly have laid her hand upon it.&nbsp; The auctioneer
had sent the request onto his employer, Mr. Brown.&nbsp; That gentleman
applied to Ellinor for her consent.&nbsp; She saw that the fact of the
intended sale must be all that Mr. Corbet was aware of, and that he
could not know to whom the books belonged.&nbsp; She chose out the book,
and wrapped and tied it up with trembling hands.&nbsp; <i>He</i> might
be the person to untie the knot.&nbsp; It was strangely familiar to
her love, after so many years, to be brought into thus much contact
with him.&nbsp; She wrote a short note to Mr. Brown, in which she requested
him to say, as though from himself; and without any mention of her name,
that he, as executor, requested Mr. Corbet&rsquo;s acceptance of the
<i>Virgil</i>, as a remembrance of his former friend and tutor.&nbsp;
Then she rang the bell, and gave the letter and parcel to the servant.</p>
<p>Again alone, and Mr. Corbet&rsquo;s open letter on the table.&nbsp;
She took it up and looked at it till the letters dazzled crimson on
the white paper.&nbsp; Her life rolled backwards, and she was a girl
again.&nbsp; At last she roused herself; but instead of destroying the
note&mdash;it was long years since all her love-letters from him had
been returned to the writer&mdash;she unlocked her little writing-case
again, and placed this letter carefully down at the bottom, among the
dead rose-leaves which embalmed the note from her father, found after
his death under his pillow, the little golden curl of her sister&rsquo;s,
the half-finished sewing of her mother.</p>
<p>The shabby writing-case itself was given her by her father long ago,
and had since been taken with her everywhere.&nbsp; To be sure, her
changes of place had been but few; but if she had gone to Nova Zembla,
the sight of that little leather box on awaking from her first sleep,
would have given her a sense of home.&nbsp; She locked the case up again,
and felt all the richer for that morning.</p>
<p>A day or two afterwards she left Hamley.&nbsp; Before she went she
compelled herself to go round the gardens and grounds of Ford Bank.&nbsp;
She had made Mrs. Osbaldistone understand that it would be painful for
her to re-enter the house; but Mr. Osbaldistone accompanied her in her
walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see how literally we have obeyed the clause in the lease
which ties us out from any alterations,&rdquo; said he, smiling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We are living in a tangled thicket of wood.&nbsp; I must confess
that I should have liked to cut down a good deal; but we do not do even
the requisite thinnings without making the proper application for leave
to Mr. Johnson.&nbsp; In fact, your old friend Dixon is jealous of every
pea-stick the gardener cuts.&nbsp; I never met with so faithful a fellow.&nbsp;
A good enough servant, too, in his way; but somewhat too old-fashioned
for my wife and daughters, who complain of his being surly now and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not thinking of parting with him?&rdquo; said Ellinor,
jealous for Dixon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; he and I are capital friends.&nbsp; And I believe
Mrs. Osbaldistone herself would never consent to his leaving us.&nbsp;
But some ladies, you know, like a little more subserviency in manner
than our friend Dixon can boast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellinor made no reply.&nbsp; They were entering the painted flower
garden, hiding the ghastly memory.&nbsp; She could not speak.&nbsp;
She felt as if, with all her striving, she could not move&mdash;just
as one does in a nightmare&mdash;but she was past the place even as
this terror came to its acme; and when she came to herself, Mr. Osbaldistone
was still blandly talking, and saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is now a reward for our obedience to your wishes, Miss
Wilkins, for if the projected railway passes through the ash-field yonder
we should have been perpetually troubled with the sight of the trains;
indeed, the sound would have been much more distinct than it will be
now coming through the interlacing branches.&nbsp; Then you will not
go in, Miss Wilkins?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Osbaldistone desired me to say
how happy&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! I can understand such feelings&mdash;Certainly,
certainly; it is so much the shortest way to the town, that we elder
ones always go through the stable-yard; for young people, it is perhaps
not quite so desirable.&nbsp; Ha! Dixon,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;on
the watch for the Miss Ellinor we so often hear of!&nbsp; This old man,&rdquo;
he continued to Ellinor, &ldquo;is never satisfied with the seat of
our young ladies, always comparing their way of riding with that of
a certain missy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot help it, sir; they&rsquo;ve quite a different style
of hand, and sit all lumpish-like.&nbsp; Now, Miss Ellinor, there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Dixon,&rdquo; she said, suddenly aware of why the old
servant was not popular with his mistress.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose I
may be allowed to ask for Dixon&rsquo;s company for an hour or so; we
have something to do together before we leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The consent given, the two walked away, as by previous appointment,
to Hamley churchyard, where he was to point out to her the exact spot
where he wished to be buried.&nbsp; Trampling over the long, rank grass,
but avoiding passing directly over any of the thickly-strewn graves,
he made straight for one spot&mdash;a little space of unoccupied ground
close by, where Molly, the pretty scullery-maid, lay:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sacred to the Memory of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; MARY GREAVES.<br />
Born 1797.&nbsp; Died 1818.<br />
&ldquo;We part to meet again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I put this stone up over her with my first savings,&rdquo;
said he, looking at it; and then, pulling out his knife, he began to
clean out the letters.&nbsp; &ldquo;I said then as I would lie by her.&nbsp;
And it&rsquo;ll be a comfort to think you&rsquo;ll see me laid here.&nbsp;
I trust no one&rsquo;ll be so crabbed as to take a fancy to this &rsquo;ere
spot of ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellinor grasped eagerly at the only pleasure which her money enabled
her to give to the old man: and promised him that she would take care
and buy the right to that particular piece of ground.&nbsp; This was
evidently a gratification Dixon had frequently yearned after; he kept
saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m greatly obleeged to ye, Miss Ellinor.&nbsp;
I may say I&rsquo;m truly obleeged.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when he saw them
off by the coach the next day, his last words were, &ldquo;I cannot
justly say how greatly I&rsquo;m obleeged to you for that matter of
the churchyard.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a much more easy affair to give
Miss Monro some additional comforts; she was as cheerful as ever; still
working away at her languages in any spare time, but confessing that
she was tired of the perpetual teaching in which her life had been spent
during the last thirty years.&nbsp; Ellinor was now enabled to set her
at liberty from this, and she accepted the kindness from her former
pupil with as much simple gratitude as that with which a mother receives
a favour from a child.&nbsp; &ldquo;If Ellinor were but married to Canon
Livingstone, I should be happier than I have ever been since my father
died,&rdquo; she used to say to herself in the solitude of her bed-chamber,
for talking aloud had become her wont in the early years of her isolated
life as a governess.&nbsp; &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what I should do without her; it is lucky for me that
things are not in my hands, for a pretty mess I should make of them,
one way or another.&nbsp; Dear! how old Mrs. Cadogan used to hate that
word &lsquo;mess,&rsquo; and correct her granddaughters for using it
right before my face, when I knew I had said it myself only the moment
before!&nbsp; Well! those days are all over now.&nbsp; God be thanked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of being glad that &ldquo;things were not in her hands&rdquo;
Miss Monro tried to take affairs into her charge by doing all she could
to persuade Ellinor to allow her to invite the canon to their &ldquo;little
sociable teas.&rdquo;&nbsp; The most provoking part was, that she was
sure he would have come if he had been asked; but she could never get
leave to do so.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course no man could go on for ever and
ever without encouragement,&rdquo; as she confided to herself in a plaintive
tone of voice; and by-and-by many people were led to suppose that the
bachelor canon was paying attention to Miss Forbes, the eldest daughter
of the family to which the delicate Jeanie belonged.&nbsp; It was, perhaps,
with the Forbeses that both Miss Monro and Ellinor were the most intimate
of all the families in East Chester.&nbsp; Mrs. Forbes was a widow lady
of good means, with a large family of pretty, delicate daughters.&nbsp;
She herself belonged to one of the great houses in ---shire, but had
married into Scotland; so, after her husband&rsquo;s death, it was the
most natural thing in the world that she should settle in East Chester;
and one after another of her daughters had become first Miss Monro&rsquo;s
pupil and afterwards her friend.&nbsp; Mrs. Forbes herself had always
been strongly attracted by Ellinor, but it was long before she could
conquer the timid reserve by which Miss Wilkins was hedged round.&nbsp;
It was Miss Monro, who was herself incapable of jealousy, who persevered
in praising them to one another, and in bringing them together; and
now Ellinor was as intimate and familiar in Mrs. Forbes&rsquo;s household
as she ever could be with any family not her own.</p>
<p>Mrs. Forbes was considered to be a little fanciful as to illness;
but it was no wonder, remembering how many sisters she had lost by consumption.&nbsp;
Miss Monro had often grumbled at the way in which her pupils were made
irregular for very trifling causes.&nbsp; But no one so alarmed as she,
when, in the autumn succeeding Mr. Ness&rsquo;s death, Mrs. Forbes remarked
to her on Ellinor&rsquo;s increased delicacy of appearance, and shortness
of breathing.&nbsp; From that time forwards she worried Ellinor (if
any one so sweet and patient could ever have been worried) with respirators
and precautions.&nbsp; Ellinor submitted to all her friend&rsquo;s wishes
and cares, sooner than make her anxious, and remained a prisoner in
the house through the whole of November.&nbsp; Then Miss Monro&rsquo;s
anxiety took another turn.&nbsp; Ellinor&rsquo;s appetite and spirits
failed her&mdash;not at all an unnatural consequence of so many weeks&rsquo;
confinement to the house.&nbsp; A plan was started, quite suddenly,
one morning in December, that met with approval from everyone but Ellinor,
who was, however, by this time too languid to make much resistance.</p>
<p>Mrs. Forbes and her daughters were going to Rome for three or four
months, so as to avoid the trying east winds of spring; why should not
Miss Wilkins go with them?&nbsp; They urged it, and Miss Monro urged
it, though with a little private sinking of the heart at the idea of
the long separation from one who was almost like a child to her.&nbsp;
Ellinor was, as it were, lifted off her feet and borne away by the unanimous
opinion of others&mdash;the doctor included&mdash;who decided that such
a step was highly desirable; if not absolutely necessary.&nbsp; She
knew that she had only a life interest both in her father&rsquo;s property
and in that bequeathed to her by Mr. Ness.&nbsp; Hitherto she had not
felt much troubled by this, as she had supposed that in the natural
course of events she should survive Miss Monro and Dixon, both of whom
she looked upon as dependent upon her.&nbsp; All she had to bequeath
to the two was the small savings, which would not nearly suffice for
both purposes, especially considering that Miss Monro had given up her
teaching, and that both she and Dixon were passing into years.</p>
<p>Before Ellinor left England she had made every arrangement for the
contingency of her death abroad that Mr. Johnson could suggest.&nbsp;
She had written and sent a long letter to Dixon; and a shorter one was
left in charge of Canon Livingstone (she dared not hint at the possibility
of her dying to Miss Monro) to be sent to the old man.</p>
<p>As they drove out of the King&rsquo;s Cross station, they passed
a gentleman&rsquo;s carriage entering.&nbsp; Ellinor saw a bright, handsome
lady, a nurse, and baby inside, and a gentleman sitting by them whose
face she could never forget.&nbsp; It was Mr. Corbet taking his wife
and child to the railway.&nbsp; They were going on a Christmas visit
to East Chester deanery.&nbsp; He had been leaning back, not noticing
the passers-by, not attending to the other inmates of the carriage,
probably absorbed in the consideration of some law case.&nbsp; Such
were the casual glimpses Ellinor had of one with whose life she had
once thought herself bound up.</p>
<p>Who so proud as Miss Monro when a foreign letter came?&nbsp; Her
correspondent was not particularly graphic in her descriptions, nor
were there any adventures to be described, nor was the habit of mind
of Ellinor such as to make her clear and definite in her own impressions
of what she saw, and her natural reserve kept her from being fluent
in communicating them even to Miss Monro.&nbsp; But that lady would
have been pleased to read aloud these letters to the assembled dean
and canons, and would not have been surprised if they had invited her
to the chapter-house for that purpose.&nbsp; To her circle of untravelled
ladies, ignorant of Murray, but laudably desirous of information, all
Ellinor&rsquo;s historical reminiscences and rather formal details were
really interesting.&nbsp; There was no railroad in those days between
Lyons and Marseilles, so their progress was slow, and the passage of
letters to and fro, when they had arrived in Rome, long and uncertain.&nbsp;
But all seemed going on well.&nbsp; Ellinor spoke of herself as in better
health; and Canon Livingstone (between whom and Miss Monro great intimacy
had sprung up since Ellinor had gone away, and Miss Monro could ask
him to tea) confirmed this report of Miss Wilkins&rsquo;s health from
a letter which he had received from Mrs. Forbes.&nbsp; Curiosity about
that letter was Miss Monro&rsquo;s torment.&nbsp; What could they have
had to write to each other about?&nbsp; It was a very odd proceeding;
although the Livingstones and Forbeses were distantly related, after
the manner of Scotland.&nbsp; Could it have been that he had offered
to Euphemia, after all, and that her mother had answered; or, possibly,
there was a letter from Effie herself, enclosed.&nbsp; It was a pity
for Miss Monro&rsquo;s peace of mind that she did not ask him straight
away.&nbsp; She would then have learnt what Canon Livingstone had no
thought of concealing, that Mrs. Forbes had written solely to give him
some fuller directions about certain charities than she had had time
to think about in the hurry of starting.&nbsp; As it was, and when,
a little later on, she heard him speak of the possibility of his going
himself to Rome, as soon as his term of residence was over, in time
for the Carnival, she gave up her fond project in despair, and felt
very much like a child whose house of bricks had been knocked down by
the unlucky waft of some passing petticoat.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the entire change of scene brought on the exquisite refreshment
of entire change of thought.&nbsp; Ellinor had not been able so completely
to forget her past life for many years; it was like a renewing of her
youth; cut so suddenly short by the shears of Fate.&nbsp; Ever since
that night, she had had to rouse herself on awakening in the morning
into a full comprehension of the great cause she had for much fear and
heavy grief.&nbsp; Now, when she wakened in her little room, fourth
piano, No. 36, Babuino, she saw the strange, pretty things around her,
and her mind went off into pleasant wonder and conjecture, happy recollections
of the day before, and pleasant anticipations of the day to come.&nbsp;
Latent in Ellinor was her father&rsquo;s artistic temperament; everything
new and strange was a picture and a delight; the merest group in the
street, a Roman facchino, with his cloak draped over his shoulder, a
girl going to market or carrying her pitcher back from the fountain,
everything and every person that presented it or himself to her senses,
gave them a delicious shock, as if it were something strangely familiar
from Pinelli, but unseen by her mortal eyes before.&nbsp; She forgot
her despondency, her ill-health disappeared as if by magic; the Misses
Forbes, who had taken the pensive, drooping invalid as a companion out
of kindness of heart, found themselves amply rewarded by the sight of
her amended health, and her keen enjoyment of everything, and the half-quaint,
half naive expressions of her pleasure.</p>
<p>So March came round; Lent was late that year.&nbsp; The great nosegays
of violets and camellias were for sale at the corner of the Condotti,
and the revellers had no difficulty in procuring much rarer flowers
for the belles of the Corso.&nbsp; The embassies had their balconies;
the attach&eacute;s of the Russian Embassy threw their light and lovely
presents at every pretty girl, or suspicion of a pretty girl, who passed
slowly in her carriage, covered over with her white domino, and holding
her wire mask as a protection to her face from the showers of lime confetti,
which otherwise would have been enough to blind her; Mrs. Forbes had
her own hired balcony, as became a wealthy and respectable Englishwoman.&nbsp;
The girls had a great basket full of bouquets with which to pelt their
friends in the crowd below; a store of moccoletti lay piled on the table
behind, for it was the last day of Carnival, and as soon as dusk came
on the tapers were to be lighted, to be as quickly extinguished by every
means in everyone&rsquo;s power.&nbsp; The crowd below was at its wildest
pitch; the rows of stately contadini alone sitting immovable as their
possible ancestors, the senators who received Brennus and his Gauls.&nbsp;
Masks and white dominoes, foreign gentlemen, and the riffraff of the
city, slow-driving carriages, showers of flowers, most of them faded
by this time, everyone shouting and struggling at that wild pitch of
excitement which may so soon turn into fury.&nbsp; The Forbes girls
had given place at the window to their mother and Ellinor, who were
gazing half amused, half terrified, at the mad parti-coloured movement
below; when a familiar face looked up, smiling a recognition; and &ldquo;How
shall I get to you?&rdquo; was asked in English, by the well-known voice
of Canon Livingstone.&nbsp; They saw him disappear under the balcony
on which they were standing, but it was some time before he made his
appearance in their room.&nbsp; And when he did, he was almost overpowered
with greetings; so glad were they to see an East Chester face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you come?&nbsp; Where are you?&nbsp; What a pity
you did not come sooner!&nbsp; It is so long since we have heard anything;
do tell us everything!&nbsp; It is three weeks since we have had any
letters; those tiresome boats have been so irregular because of the
weather.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How was everybody&mdash;Miss Monro in particular?&rdquo;
Ellinor asks.</p>
<p>He, quietly smiling, replied to their questions by slow degrees.&nbsp;
He had only arrived the night before, and had been hunting for them
all day; but no one could give him any distinct intelligence as to their
whereabouts in all the noise and confusion of the place, especially
as they had their only English servant with them, and the canon was
not strong in his Italian.&nbsp; He was not sorry he had missed all
but this last day of carnival, for he was half blinded and wholly deafened,
as it was.&nbsp; He was at the &ldquo;Angleterre;&rdquo; he had left
East Chester about a week ago; he had letters for all of them, but had
not dared to bring them through the crowd for fear of having his pocket
picked.&nbsp; Miss Monro was very well, but very uneasy at not having
heard from Ellinor for so long; the irregularity of the boats must be
telling both ways, for their English friends were full of wonder at
not hearing from Rome.&nbsp; And then followed some well-deserved abuse
of the Roman post, and some suspicion of the carelessness with which
Italian servants posted English letters.&nbsp; All these answers were
satisfactory enough, yet Mrs. Forbes thought she saw a latent uneasiness
in Canon Livingstone&rsquo;s manner, and fancied once or twice that
he hesitated in replying to Ellinor&rsquo;s questions.&nbsp; But there
was no being quite sure in the increasing darkness, which prevented
countenances from being seen; nor in the constant interruptions and
screams which were going on in the small crowded room, as wafting handkerchiefs,
puffs of wind, or veritable extinguishers, fastened to long sticks,
and coming from nobody knew where, put out taper after taper as fast
as they were lighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will come home with us,&rdquo; said Mrs. Forbes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I can only offer you cold meat with tea; our cook is gone out,
this being a universal festa; but we cannot part with an old friend
for any scruples as to the commissariat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&nbsp; I should have invited myself if you had not
been good enough to ask me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had all arrived at their apartment in the Babuino (Canon
Livingstone had gone round to fetch the letters with which he was entrusted),
Mrs. Forbes was confirmed in her supposition that he had something particular
and not very pleasant to say to Ellinor, by the rather grave and absent
manner in which he awaited her return from taking off her out-of-door
things.&nbsp; He broke off, indeed, in his conversation with Mrs. Forbes
to go and meet Ellinor, and to lead her into the most distant window
before he delivered her letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what you said in the balcony yonder, I fear you have
not received your home letters regularly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; replied she, startled and trembling, she hardly
knew why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more has Miss Monro heard from you; nor, I believe, has
some one else who expected to hear.&nbsp; Your man of business&mdash;I
forget his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My man of business!&nbsp; Something has gone wrong, Mr. Livingstone.&nbsp;
Tell me&mdash;I want to know.&nbsp; I have been expecting it&mdash;only
tell me.&rdquo;&nbsp; She sat down suddenly, as white as ashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Miss Wilkins, I&rsquo;m afraid it is painful enough,
but you are fancying it worse than it is.&nbsp; All your friends are
quite well; but an old servant&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she said, seeing his hesitation, and leaning
forwards and griping at his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is taken up on a charge of manslaughter or murder.&nbsp; Oh!
Mrs. Forbes, come here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Ellinor had fainted, falling forwards on the arm she had held.&nbsp;
When she came round she was lying half undressed on her bed; they were
giving her tea in spoonfuls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must get up,&rdquo; she moaned.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must lie still,&rdquo; said Mrs. Forbes, firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I must go home,&rdquo; she repeated;
and she tried to sit up, but fell back helpless.&nbsp; Then she did
not speak, but lay and thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you bring me some
meat?&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;And some wine?&rdquo;&nbsp;
They brought her meat and wine; she ate, though she was choking.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now, please, bring me my letters, and leave me alone; and after
that I should like to speak to Canon Livingstone.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
let him go, please.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t be long&mdash;half an hour,
I think.&nbsp; Only let me be alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a hurried feverish sharpness in her tone that made Mrs.
Forbes very anxious, but she judged it best to comply with her requests.</p>
<p>The letters were brought, the lights were arranged so that she could
read them lying on her bed; and they left her.&nbsp; Then she got up
and stood on her feet, dizzy enough, her arms clasped at the top of
her head, her eyes dilated and staring as if looking at some great horror.&nbsp;
But after a few minutes she sat down suddenly, and began to read.&nbsp;
Letters were evidently missing.&nbsp; Some had been sent by an opportunity
that had been delayed on the journey, and had not yet arrived in Rome.&nbsp;
Others had been despatched by the post, but the severe weather, the
unusual snow, had, in those days, before the railway was made between
Lyons and Marseilles, put a stop to many a traveller&rsquo;s plans,
and had rendered the transmission of the mail extremely uncertain; so,
much of that intelligence which Miss Monro had evidently considered
as certain to be known to Ellinor was entirely matter of conjecture,
and could only be guessed at from what was told in these letters.&nbsp;
One was from Mr. Johnson, one from Mr. Brown, one from Miss Monro; of
course the last mentioned was the first read.&nbsp; She spoke of the
shock of the discovery of Mr. Dunster&rsquo;s body, found in the cutting
of the new line of railroad from Hamley to the nearest railway station;
the body so hastily buried long ago, in its clothes, by which it was
now recognised&mdash;a recognition confirmed by one or two more personal
and indestructible things, such as his watch and seal with his initials;
of the shock to everyone, the Osbaldistones in particular, on the further
discovery of a fleam or horse-lancet, having the name of Abraham Dixon
engraved on the handle; how Dixon had gone on Mr. Osbaldistone&rsquo;s
business to a horse-fair in Ireland some weeks before this, and had
had his leg broken by a kick from an unruly mare, so that he was barely
able to move about when the officers of justice went to apprehend him
in Tralee.</p>
<p>At this point Ellinor cried out loud and shrill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dixon! Dixon! and I was away enjoying myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They heard her cry, and came to the door, but it was bolted inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, go away,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;please, go.&nbsp;
I will be very quiet; only, please, go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not bear just then to read any more of Miss Monro&rsquo;s
letter; she tore open Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s&mdash;the date was a fortnight
earlier than Miss Monro&rsquo;s; he also expressed his wonder at not
hearing from her, in reply to his letter of January 9; but he added,
that he thought that her trustees had judged rightly; the handsome sum
the railway company had offered for the land when their surveyor decided
on the alteration of the line, Mr. Osbaldistone, &amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp;
She could not read anymore; it was Fate pursuing her.&nbsp; Then she
took the letter up again and tried to read; but all that reached her
understanding was the fact that Mr. Johnson had sent his present letter
to Miss Monro, thinking that she might know of some private opportunity
safer than the post.&nbsp; Mr. Brown&rsquo;s was just such a letter
as he occasionally sent her from time to time; a correspondence that
arose out of their mutual regard for their dead friend Mr. Ness.&nbsp;
It, too, had been sent to Miss Monro to direct.&nbsp; Ellinor was on
the point of putting it aside entirely, when the name of Corbet caught
her eye: &ldquo;You will be interested to hear that the old pupil of
our departed friend, who was so anxious to obtain the folio <i>Virgil</i>
with the Italian notes, is appointed the new judge in room of Mr. Justice
Jenkin.&nbsp; At least I conclude that Mr. Ralph Corbet, Q.C., is the
same as the <i>Virgil</i> fancier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ellinor, bitterly; &ldquo;he judged well;
it would never have done.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were the first words of
anything like reproach which she ever formed in her own mind during
all these years.&nbsp; She thought for a few moments of the old times;
it seemed to steady her brain to think of them.&nbsp; Then she took
up and finished Miss Monro&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; That excellent friend
had done all which she thought Ellinor would have wished without delay.&nbsp;
She had written to Mr. Johnson, and charged him to do everything he
could to defend Dixon and to spare no expense.&nbsp; She was thinking
of going to the prison in the county town, to see the old man herself,
but Ellinor could perceive that all these endeavours and purposes of
Miss Monro&rsquo;s were based on love for her own pupil, and a desire
to set her mind at ease as far as she could, rather than from any idea
that Dixon himself could be innocent.&nbsp; Ellinor put down the letters,
and went to the door, then turned back, and locked them up in her writing-case
with trembling hands; and after that she entered the drawing-room, looking
liker to a ghost than to a living woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I speak to you for a minute alone?&rdquo;&nbsp; Her still,
tuneless voice made the words into a command.&nbsp; Canon Livingstone
arose and followed her into the little dining-room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will
you tell me all you know&mdash;all you have heard about my&mdash;you
know what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Monro was my informant&mdash;at least at first&mdash;it
was in the <i>Times</i> the day before I left.&nbsp; Miss Monro says
it could only have been done in a moment of anger if the old servant
is really guilty; that he was as steady and good a man as she ever knew,
and she seems to have a strong feeling against Mr. Dunster, as always
giving your father much unnecessary trouble; in fact, she hints that
his disappearance at the time was supposed to be the cause of a considerable
loss of property to Mr. Wilkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Ellinor, eagerly, feeling that some justice
ought to be done to the dead man; and then she stopped short, fearful
of saying anything that should betray her full knowledge.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
mean this,&rdquo; she went on; &ldquo;Mr. Dunster was a very disagreeable
man personally&mdash;and papa&mdash;we none of us liked him; but he
was quite honest&mdash;please remember that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The canon bowed, and said a few acquiescing words.&nbsp; He waited
for her to speak again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Monro says she is going to see Dixon in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Livingstone, I can&rsquo;t bear it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He let her alone, looking at her pitifully, as she twisted and wrung
her hands together in her endeavour to regain the quiet manner she had
striven to maintain through the interview.&nbsp; She looked up at him
with a poor attempt at an apologetic smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so terrible to think of that good old man in prison!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not believe him guilty!&rdquo; said Canon Livingstone,
in some surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am afraid, from all I heard and read,
there is but little doubt that he did kill the man; I trust in some
moment of irritation, with no premeditated malice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellinor shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon can I get to England?&rdquo; asked she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
must start at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Forbes sent out while you were lying down.&nbsp; I am
afraid there is no boat to Marseilles till Thursday, the day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must go sooner!&rdquo; said Ellinor, starting up.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I must go; please help me.&nbsp; He may be tried before I can
get there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&nbsp; I fear that will be the case, whatever haste you
make.&nbsp; The trial was to come on at the Hellingford Assizes, and
that town stands first on the Midland Circuit list.&nbsp; To-day is
the 27th of February; the assizes begin on the 7th of March.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will start to-morrow morning early for Civita; there may
be a boat there they do not know of here.&nbsp; At any rate, I shall
be on my way.&nbsp; If he dies, I must die too.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know what I am saying, I am so utterly crushed down!&nbsp; It would
be such a kindness if you would go away, and let no one come to me.&nbsp;
I know Mrs. Forbes is so good, she will forgive me.&nbsp; I will say
good-by to you all before I go to-morrow morning; but I must think now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For one moment he stood looking at her as if he longed to comfort
her by more words.&nbsp; He thought better of it, however, and silently
left the room.</p>
<p>For a long time Ellinor sat still; now and then taking up Miss Monro&rsquo;s
letter, and re-reading the few terrible details.&nbsp; Then she bethought
her that possibly the canon might have brought a copy of the <i>Times</i>,
containing the examination of Dixon before the magistrates, and she
opened the door and called to a passing servant to make the inquiry.&nbsp;
She was quite right in her conjecture; Dr. Livingstone had had the paper
in his pocket during his interview with her; but he thought the evidence
so conclusive, that the perusal of it would only be adding to her extreme
distress by accelerating the conviction of Dixon&rsquo;s guilt, which
he believed she must arrive at sooner or later.</p>
<p>He had been reading the report over with Mrs. Forbes and her daughters,
after his return from Ellinor&rsquo;s room, and they were all participating
in his opinion upon it, when her request for the <i>Times</i> was brought.&nbsp;
They had reluctantly agreed, saying there did not appear to be a shadow
of doubt on the fact of Dixon&rsquo;s having killed Mr. Dunster, only
hoping there might prove to be some extenuating circumstances, which
Ellinor had probably recollected, and which she was desirous of producing
on the approaching trial.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p>Ellinor, having read the report of Dixon&rsquo;s examination in the
newspaper, bathed her eyes and forehead in cold water, and tried to
still her poor heart&rsquo;s beating, that she might be clear and collected
enough to weigh the evidence.</p>
<p>Every line of it was condemnatory.&nbsp; One or two witnesses spoke
of Dixon&rsquo;s unconcealed dislike of Dunster, a dislike which Ellinor
knew had been entertained by the old servant out of a species of loyalty
to his master, as well as from personal distaste.&nbsp; The fleam was
proved beyond all doubt to be Dixon&rsquo;s; and a man, who had been
stable-boy in Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s service, swore that on the day when
Mr. Dunster was missed, and when the whole town was wondering what had
become of him, a certain colt of Mr. Wilkins&rsquo;s had needed bleeding,
and that he had been sent by Dixon to the farrier&rsquo;s for a horse-lancet,
an errand which he had remarked upon at the time, as he knew that Dixon
had a fleam of his own.</p>
<p>Mr. Osbaldistone was examined.&nbsp; He kept interrupting himself
perpetually to express his surprise at the fact of so steady and well-conducted
a man as Dixon being guilty of so heinous a crime, and was willing enough
to testify to the excellent character which he had borne during all
the many years he had been in his (Mr. Osbaldistone&rsquo;s) service;
but he appeared to be quite convinced by the evidence previously given
of the prisoner&rsquo;s guilt in the matter, and strengthened the case
against him materially by stating the circumstance of the old man&rsquo;s
dogged unwillingness to have the slightest interference by cultivation
with that particular piece of ground.</p>
<p>Here Ellinor shuddered.&nbsp; Before her, in that Roman bed-chamber,
rose the fatal oblong she knew by heart&mdash;a little green moss or
lichen, and thinly-growing blades of grass scarcely covering the caked
and undisturbed soil under the old tree.&nbsp; Oh, that she had been
in England when the surveyors of the railway between Ashcombe and Hamley
had altered their line; she would have entreated, implored, compelled
her trustees not to have sold that piece of ground for any sum of money
whatever.&nbsp; She would have bribed the surveyors, done she knew not
what&mdash;but now it was too late; she would not let her mind wander
off to what might have been; she would force herself again to attend
to the newspaper columns.&nbsp; There was little more: the prisoner
had been asked if he could say anything to clear himself, and properly
cautioned not to say anything to incriminate himself.&nbsp; The poor
old man&rsquo;s person was described, and his evident emotion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The prisoner was observed to clutch at the rail before him to
steady himself, and his colour changed so much at this part of the evidence
that one of the turnkeys offered him a glass of water, which he declined.&nbsp;
He is a man of a strongly-built frame, and with rather a morose and
sullen cast of countenance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor, poor Dixon!&rdquo; said Ellinor, laying down the
paper for an instant, and she was near crying, only she had resolved
to shed no tears till she had finished all, and could judge of the chances.&nbsp;
There were but a few lines more: &ldquo;At one time the prisoner seemed
to be desirous of alleging something in his defence, but he changed
his mind, if such had been the case, and in reply to Mr. Gordon (the
magistrate) he only said, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve made a pretty strong case
out again me, gentlemen, and it seems for to satisfy you; so I think
I&rsquo;ll not disturb your minds by saying anything more.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Accordingly, Dixon now stands committed for trial for murder at the
next Hellingford Assizes, which commence on March the seventh, before
Baron Rushton and Mr. Justice Corbet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Justice Corbet!&rdquo;&nbsp; The words ran through Ellinor
as though she had been stabbed with a knife, and by an irrepressible
movement she stood up rigid.&nbsp; The young man, her lover in her youth,
the old servant who in those days was perpetually about her&mdash;the
two who had so often met in familiar if not friendly relations, now
to face each other as judge and accused!&nbsp; She could not tell how
much Mr. Corbet had conjectured from the partial revelation she had
made to him of the impending shame that hung over her and hers.&nbsp;
A day or two ago she could have remembered the exact words she had used
in that memorable interview; but now, strive as she would, she could
only recall facts, not words.&nbsp; After all, the Mr. Justice Corbet
might not be Ralph.&nbsp; There was one chance in a hundred against
the identity of the two.</p>
<p>While she was weighing probabilities in her sick dizzy mind, she
heard soft steps outside her bolted door, and low voices whispering.&nbsp;
It was the bedtime of happy people with hearts at ease.&nbsp; Some of
the footsteps passed lightly on; but there was a gentle rap at Ellinor&rsquo;s
door.&nbsp; She pressed her two hot hands hard against her temples for
an instant before she went to open the door.&nbsp; There stood Mrs.
Forbes in her handsome evening dress, holding a lighted lamp in her
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I come in, my dear?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp; Ellinor&rsquo;s
stiff dry lips refused to utter the words of assent which indeed did
not come readily from her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so grieved at this sad news which the canon brings.&nbsp;
I can well understand what a shock it must be to you; we have just been
saying it must be as bad for you as it would be to us if our old Donald
should turn out to have been a hidden murderer all these years that
he has lived with us; I really could have as soon suspected Donald as
that white-haired respectable old man who used to come and see you at
East Chester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellinor felt that she must say something.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a terrible
shock&mdash;poor old man! and no friend near him, even Mr. Osbaldistone
giving evidence again him.&nbsp; Oh, dear, dear! why did I ever come
to Rome?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear, you must not let yourself take an exaggerated
view of the case.&nbsp; Sad and shocking as it is to have been so deceived,
it is what happens to many of us, though not to so terrible a degree;
and as to your coming to Rome having anything to do with it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Mrs. Forbes almost smiled at the idea, so anxious was she to banish
the idea of self-reproach from Ellinor&rsquo;s sensitive mind, but Ellinor
interrupted her abruptly:)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Forbes! did he&mdash;did Canon Livingstone tell you that
I must leave to-morrow?&nbsp; I must go to England as fast as possible
to do what I can for Dixon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he told us you were thinking of it, and it was partly
that made me force myself in upon you to-night.&nbsp; I think, my love,
you are mistaken in feeling as if you were called upon to do more than
what the canon tells me Miss Monro has already done in your name&mdash;engaged
the best legal advice, and spared no expense to give the suspected man
every chance.&nbsp; What could you do more even if you were on the spot?&nbsp;
And it is very possible that the trial may have come on before you get
home.&nbsp; Then what could you do?&nbsp; He would either have been
acquitted or condemned; if the former, he would find public sympathy
all in his favour; it always is for the unjustly accused.&nbsp; And
if he turns out to be guilty, my dear Ellinor, it will be far better
for you to have all the softening which distance can give to such a
dreadful termination to the life of a poor man whom you have respected
so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ellinor spoke again with a kind of irritated determination, very
foreign to her usual soft docility:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please just let me judge for myself this once.&nbsp; I am
not ungrateful.&nbsp; God knows I don&rsquo;t want to vex one who has
been so kind to me as you have been, dear Mrs. Forbes; but I must go&mdash;and
every word you say to dissuade me only makes me more convinced.&nbsp;
I am going to Civita to-morrow.&nbsp; I shall be that much on the way.&nbsp;
I cannot rest here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Forbes looked at her in grave silence.&nbsp; Ellinor could not
bear the consciousness of that fixed gaze.&nbsp; Yet its fixity only
arose from Mrs. Forbes&rsquo; perplexity as to how best to assist Ellinor,
whether to restrain her by further advice&mdash;of which the first dose
had proved so useless&mdash;or to speed her departure.&nbsp; Ellinor
broke on her meditations:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have always been so kind and good to me,&mdash;go on being
so&mdash;please, do!&nbsp; Leave me alone now, dear Mrs. Forbes, for
I cannot bear talking about it, and help me to go to-morrow, and you
do not know how I will pray to God to bless you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such an appeal was irresistible.&nbsp; Mrs. Forbes kissed her very
tenderly, and went to rejoin her daughters, who were clustered together
in their mother&rsquo;s bedroom awaiting her coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, mamma, how is she?&nbsp; What does she say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is in a very excited state, poor thing! and has got so
strong an impression that it is her duty to go back to England and do
all she can for this wretched old man, that I am afraid we must not
oppose her.&nbsp; I am afraid that she really must go on Thursday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Mrs. Forbes secured the services of a travelling-maid, Dr.
Livingstone insisted on accompanying Ellinor to England, and it would
have required more energy than she possessed at this time to combat
a resolution which both words and manner expressed as determined.&nbsp;
She would much rather have travelled alone with her maid; she did not
feel the need of the services he offered; but she was utterly listless
and broken down; all her interest was centred in the thought of Dixon
and his approaching trial, and perplexity as to the mode in which she
must do her duty.</p>
<p>They embarked late that evening in the tardy <i>Santa Lucia</i>,
and Ellinor immediately went to her berth.&nbsp; She was not sea-sick;
that might possibly have lessened her mental sufferings, which all night
long tormented her.&nbsp; High-perched in an upper berth, she did not
like disturbing the other occupants of the cabin till daylight appeared.&nbsp;
Then she descended and dressed, and went on deck; the vessel was just
passing the rocky coast of Elba, and the sky was flushed with rosy light,
that made the shadows on the island of the most exquisite purple.&nbsp;
The sea still heaved with yesterday&rsquo;s storm, but the motion only
added to the beauty of the sparkles and white foam that dimpled and
curled on the blue waters.&nbsp; The air was delicious, after the closeness
of the cabin, and Ellinor only wondered that more people were not on
deck to enjoy it.&nbsp; One or two stragglers came up, time after time,
and began pacing the deck.&nbsp; Dr. Livingstone came up before very
long; but he seemed to have made a rule of not obtruding himself on
Ellinor, excepting when he could be of some use.&nbsp; After a few words
of common-place morning greeting, he, too, began to walk backwards and
forwards, while Ellinor sat quietly watching the lovely island receding
fast from her view&mdash;a beautiful vision never to be seen again by
her mortal eyes.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a shock and stound all over the vessel, her progress
was stopped, and a rocking vibration was felt everywhere.&nbsp; The
quarter-deck was filled with blasts of steam, which obscured everything.&nbsp;
Sick people came rushing up out of their berths in strange undress;
the steerage passengers&mdash;a motley and picturesque set of people,
in many varieties of gay costume&mdash;took refuge on the quarter-deck,
speaking loudly in all varieties of French and Italian <i>patois</i>.&nbsp;
Ellinor stood up in silent, wondering dismay.&nbsp; Was the <i>Santa
Lucia</i> going down on the great deep, and Dixon unaided in his peril?&nbsp;
Dr. Livingstone was by her side in a moment.&nbsp; She could scarcely
see him for the vapour, nor hear him for the roar of the escaping steam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be unnecessarily frightened,&rdquo; he repeated, a
little louder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some accident has occurred to the engines.&nbsp;
I will go and make instant inquiry, and come back to you as soon as
I can.&nbsp; Trust to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came back to where she sat trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A part of the engine is broken, through the carelessness of
these Neapolitan engineers; they say we must make for the nearest port&mdash;return
to Civita, in fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Elba is not many miles away,&rdquo; said Ellinor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If this steam were but away, you could see it still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we were landed there we might stay on the island for
many days; no steamer touches there; but if we return to Civita, we
shall be in time for the Sunday boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, dear!&rdquo; said Ellinor.&nbsp; &ldquo;To-day is
the second&mdash;Sunday will be the fourth&mdash;the assizes begin on
the seventh; how miserably unfortunate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is.&nbsp; And these things
always appear so doubly unfortunate when they hinder our serving others!&nbsp;
But it does not follow that because the assizes begin at Hellingford
on the seventh, Dixon&rsquo;s trial will come on so soon.&nbsp; We may
still get to Marseilles on Monday evening; on by diligence to Lyons;
it will&mdash;it must, I fear, be Thursday, at the earliest, before
we reach Paris&mdash;Thursday, the eighth&mdash;and I suppose you know
of some exculpatory evidence that has to be hunted up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added this unwillingly; for he saw that Ellinor was jealous of
the secresy she had hitherto maintained as to her reasons for believing
Dixon innocent; but he could not help thinking that she, a gentle, timid
woman, unaccustomed to action or business, would require some of the
assistance which he would have been so thankful to give her; especially
as this untoward accident would increase the press of time in which
what was to be done would have to be done.</p>
<p>But no.&nbsp; Ellinor scarcely replied to his half-inquiry as to
her reasons for hastening to England.&nbsp; She yielded to all his directions,
agreed to his plans, but gave him none of her confidence, and he had
to submit to this exclusion from sympathy in the exact causes of her
anxiety.</p>
<p>Once more in the dreary sala, with the gaudy painted ceiling, the
bare dirty floor, the innumerable rattling doors and windows!&nbsp;
Ellinor was submissive and patient in demeanour, because so sick and
despairing at heart.&nbsp; Her maid was ten times as demonstrative of
annoyance and disgust; she who had no particular reason for wanting
to reach England, but who thought it became her dignity to make it seem
as though she had.</p>
<p>At length the weary time was over; and again they sailed past Elba,
and arrived at Marseilles.&nbsp; Now Ellinor began to feel how much
assistance it was to her to have Dr. Livingstone for a &ldquo;courier,&rdquo;
as he had several times called himself.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Where now?&rdquo; said the canon, as they approached the London
Bridge station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Great Western,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;Hellingford
is on that line, I see.&nbsp; But, please, now we must part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I may not go with you to Hellingford?&nbsp; At any rate,
you will allow me to go with you to the railway station, and do my last
office as courier in getting you your ticket and placing you in the
carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went together to the station, and learnt that no train was
leaving for Hellingford for two hours.&nbsp; There was nothing for it
but to go to the hotel close by, and pass away the time as best they
could.</p>
<p>Ellinor called for her maid&rsquo;s accounts, and dismissed her.&nbsp;
Some refreshment that the canon had ordered was eaten, and the table
cleared.&nbsp; He began walking up and down the room, his arms folded,
his eyes cast down.&nbsp; Every now and then he looked at the clock
on the mantelpiece.&nbsp; When that showed that it only wanted a quarter
of an hour to the time appointed for the train to start, he came up
to Ellinor, who sat leaning her head upon her hand, her hand resting
on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Wilkins,&rdquo; he began&mdash;and there was something
peculiar in his tone which startled Ellinor&mdash;&ldquo;I am sure you
will not scruple to apply to me if in any possible way I can help you
in this sad trouble of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No indeed I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Ellinor, gratefully,
and putting out her hand as a token.&nbsp; He took it, and held it;
she went on, a little more hastily than before: &ldquo;You know you
were so good as to say you would go at once and see Miss Monro, and
tell her all you know, and that I will write to her as soon as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I not ask for one line?&rdquo; he continued, still holding
her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly: so kind a friend as you shall hear all I can tell;
that is, all I am at liberty to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend!&nbsp; Yes, I am a friend; and I will not urge any
other claim just now.&nbsp; Perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellinor could not affect to misunderstand him.&nbsp; His manner implied
even more than his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said, eagerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are friends.&nbsp;
That is it.&nbsp; I think we shall always be friends, though I will
tell you now&mdash;something&mdash;this much&mdash;it is a sad secret.&nbsp;
God help me!&nbsp; I am as guilty as poor Dixon, if, indeed, he is guilty&mdash;but
he is innocent&mdash;indeed he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he is no more guilty than you, I am sure he is!&nbsp; Let
me be more than your friend, Ellinor&mdash;let me know all, and help
you all that I can, with the right of an affianced husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said she, frightened both at what she had revealed,
and his eager, warm, imploring manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;That can never be.&nbsp;
You do not know the disgrace that may be hanging over me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is all,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I take my risk&mdash;if
that is all&mdash;if you only fear that I may shrink from sharing any
peril you may be exposed to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not peril&mdash;it is shame and obloquy&mdash;&rdquo;
she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! shame and obloquy.&nbsp; Perhaps, if I knew all I could
shield you from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, pray, speak any more about it now; if you do,
I must say &lsquo;No.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not perceive the implied encouragement in these words; but
he did, and they sufficed to make him patient.</p>
<p>The time was up, and he could only render her his last services as
&ldquo;courier,&rdquo; and none other but the necessary words at starting
passed between them.</p>
<p>But he went away from the station with a cheerful heart; while she,
sitting alone and quiet, and at last approaching near to the place where
so much was to be decided, felt sadder and sadder, heavier and heavier.</p>
<p>All the intelligence she had gained since she had seen the <i>Galignani</i>
in Paris, had been from the waiter at the Great Western Hotel, who,
after returning from a vain search for an unoccupied <i>Times</i>, had
volunteered the information that there was an unusual demand for the
paper because of Hellingford Assizes, and the trial there for murder
that was going on.</p>
<p>There was no electric telegraph in those days; at every station Ellinor
put her head out, and enquired if the murder trial at Hellingford was
ended.&nbsp; Some porters told her one thing, some another, in their
hurry; she felt that she could not rely on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive to Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s in the High street&mdash;quick,
quick.&nbsp; I will give you half-a-crown if you will go quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For, indeed, her endurance, her patience, was strained almost to
snapping; yet at Hellingford station, where doubtless they could have
told her the truth, she dared not ask the question.&nbsp; It was past
eight o&rsquo;clock at night.&nbsp; In many houses in the little country
town there were unusual lights and sounds.&nbsp; The inhabitants were
showing their hospitality to such of the strangers brought by the assizes,
as were lingering there now that the business which had drawn them was
over.&nbsp; The Judges had left the town that afternoon, to wind up
the circuit by the short list of a neighbouring county town.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson was entertaining a dinner-party of attorneys when he
was summoned from dessert by the announcement of a &ldquo;lady who wanted
to speak to him immediate and particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went into his study in not the best of tempers.&nbsp; There he
found his client, Miss Wilkins, white and ghastly, standing by the fireplace,
with her eyes fixed on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is you, Miss Wilkins!&nbsp; I am very glad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dixon!&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; It was all she could utter.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah; that&rsquo;s a sad piece of business, and I&rsquo;m afraid
it has shortened your visit at Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s no doubt of his guilt.&nbsp;
At any rate, the jury found him guilty, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And!&rdquo; she repeated, quickly, sitting down, the better
to hear the words that she knew were coming&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is condemned to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Saturday but one after the Judges left the town, I suppose&mdash;it&rsquo;s
the usual time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who tried him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judge Corbet; and, for a new judge, I must say I never knew
one who got through his business so well.&nbsp; It was really as much
as I could stand to hear him condemning the prisoner to death.&nbsp;
Dixon was undoubtedly guilty, and he was as stubborn as could be&mdash;a
sullen old fellow who would let no one help him through.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
sure I did my best for him at Miss Monro&rsquo;s desire and for your
sake.&nbsp; But he would furnish me with no particulars, help us to
no evidence.&nbsp; I had the hardest work to keep him from confessing
all before witnesses, who would have been bound to repeat it as evidence
against him.&nbsp; Indeed, I never thought he would have pleaded &lsquo;Not
Guilty.&rsquo;&nbsp; I think it was only with a desire to justify himself
in the eyes of some old Hamley acquaintances.&nbsp; Good God, Miss Wilkins!&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not fainting!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He rang the bell till the rope remained in his hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,
Esther!&nbsp; Jerry!&nbsp; Whoever you are, come quick!&nbsp; Miss Wilkins
has fainted!&nbsp; Water!&nbsp; Wine!&nbsp; Tell Mrs. Johnson to come
here directly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Johnson, a kind, motherly woman, who had been excluded from
the &ldquo;gentleman&rsquo;s dinner party,&rdquo; and had devoted her
time to superintending the dinner her husband had ordered, came in answer
to his call for assistance, and found Ellinor lying back in her chair
white and senseless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bessy, Miss Wilkins has fainted; she has had a long journey,
and is in a fidget about Dixon, the old fellow who was sentenced to
be hung for that murder, you know.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t stop here, I
must go back to those men.&nbsp; You bring her round, and see her to
bed.&nbsp; The blue room is empty since Horner left.&nbsp; She must
stop here, and I&rsquo;ll see her in the morning.&nbsp; Take care of
her, and keep her mind as easy as you can, will you, for she can do
no good by fidgeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, knowing that he left Ellinor in good hands, and with plenty
of assistance about her, he returned to his friends.</p>
<p>Ellinor came to herself before long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very foolish of me, but I could not help it,&rdquo;
said she, apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; to be sure not, dear.&nbsp; Here, drink this; it is some
of Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s best port wine that he has sent out on purpose
for you.&nbsp; Or would you rather have some white soup&mdash;or what?&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ve had everything you could think of for dinner, and you&rsquo;ve
only to ask and have.&nbsp; And then you must go to bed, my dear&mdash;Mr.
Johnson says you must; and there&rsquo;s a well-aired room, for Mr.
Horner only left us this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must see Mr. Johnson again, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But indeed you must not.&nbsp; You must not worry your poor
head with business now; and Johnson would only talk to you on business.&nbsp;
No; go to bed, and sleep soundly, and then you&rsquo;ll get up quite
bright and strong, and fit to talk about business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot sleep&mdash;I cannot rest till I have asked Mr. Johnson
one or two more questions; indeed I cannot,&rdquo; pleaded Ellinor.</p>
<p>Mrs. Johnson knew that her husband&rsquo;s orders on such occasions
were peremptory, and that she should come in for a good conjugal scolding
if, after what he had said, she ventured to send for him again.&nbsp;
Yet Ellinor looked so entreating and wistful that she could hardly find
in her heart to refuse her.&nbsp; A bright thought struck her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is pen and paper, my dear.&nbsp; Could you not write
the questions you wanted to ask? and he&rsquo;ll just jot down the answers
upon the same piece of paper.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll send it in by Jerry.&nbsp;
He has got friends to dinner with him, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellinor yielded.&nbsp; She sat, resting her weary head on her hand,
and wondering what were the questions which would have come so readily
to her tongue could she have been face to face with him.&nbsp; As it
was, she only wrote this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How early can I see you to-morrow morning?&nbsp; Will you
take all the necessary steps for my going to Dixon as soon as possible?&nbsp;
Could I be admitted to him to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pencilled answers were:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he knows best,&rdquo; said Ellinor, sighing, as
she read the last word.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it seems wicked in me to be
going to bed&mdash;and he so near, in prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she rose up and stood, she felt the former dizziness return,
and that reconciled her to seeking rest before she entered upon the
duties which were becoming clearer before her, now that she knew all
and was on the scene of action.&nbsp; Mrs. Johnson brought her white-wine
whey instead of the tea she had asked for; and perhaps it was owing
to this that she slept so soundly.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<p>When Ellinor awoke the clear light of dawn was fully in the room.&nbsp;
She could not remember where she was; for so many mornings she had wakened
up in strange places that it took her several minutes before she could
make out the geographical whereabouts of the heavy blue moreen curtains,
the print of the lord-lieutenant of the county on the wall, and all
the handsome ponderous mahogany furniture that stuffed up the room.&nbsp;
As soon as full memory came into her mind, she started up; nor did she
go to bed again, although she saw by her watch on the dressing-table
that it was not yet six o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; She dressed herself with
the dainty completeness so habitual to her that it had become an unconscious
habit, and then&mdash;the instinct was irrepressible&mdash;she put on
her bonnet and shawl, and went down, past the servant on her knees cleaning
the doorstep, out into the fresh open air; and so she found her way
down the High Street to Hellingford Castle, the building in which the
courts of assize were held&mdash;the prison in which Dixon lay condemned
to die.&nbsp; She almost knew she could not see him; yet it seemed like
some amends to her conscience for having slept through so many hours
of the night if she made the attempt.&nbsp; She went up to the porter&rsquo;s
lodge, and asked the little girl sweeping out the place if she might
see Abraham Dixon.&nbsp; The child stared at her, and ran into the house,
bringing out her father, a great burly man, who had not yet donned either
coat or waistcoat, and who, consequently, felt the morning air as rather
nipping.&nbsp; To him Ellinor repeated her question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him as is to be hung come Saturday se&rsquo;nnight?&nbsp;
Why, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;ve nought to do with it.&nbsp; You may go
to the governor&rsquo;s house and try; but, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me,
you&rsquo;ll have your walk for your pains.&nbsp; Them in the condemned
cells is never seen by nobody without the sheriff&rsquo;s order.&nbsp;
You may go up to the governor&rsquo;s house and welcome; but they&rsquo;ll
only tell you the same.&nbsp; Yon&rsquo;s the governor&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellinor fully believed the man, and yet she went on to the house
indicated, as if she still hoped that in her case there might be some
exception to the rule, which she now remembered to have heard of before,
in days when such a possible desire as to see a condemned prisoner was
treated by her as a wish that some people might have, did have&mdash;people
as far removed from her circle of circumstances as the inhabitants of
the moon.&nbsp; Of course she met with the same reply, a little more
abruptly given, as if every man was from his birth bound to know such
an obvious regulation.</p>
<p>She went out past the porter, now fully clothed.&nbsp; He was sorry
for her disappointment, but could not help saying, with a slight tone
of exultation: &ldquo;Well, you see I was right, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She walked as nearly round the castle as ever she could, looking
up at the few high-barred windows she could see, and wondering in what
part of the building Dixon was confined.&nbsp; Then she went into the
adjoining churchyard, and sitting down upon a tombstone, she gazed idly
at the view spread below her&mdash;a view which was considered as the
lion of the place, to be shown to all strangers by the inhabitants of
Hellingford.&nbsp; Ellinor did not see it, however; she only saw the
blackness of that fatal night, the hurried work&mdash;the lanterns glancing
to and fro.&nbsp; She only heard the hard breathing of those who are
engaged upon unwonted labour; the few hoarse muttered words; the swaying
of the branches to and fro.&nbsp; All at once the church clock above
her struck eight, and then pealed out for distant labourers to cease
their work for a time.&nbsp; Such was the old custom of the place.&nbsp;
Ellinor rose up, and made her way back to Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s house
in High Street.&nbsp; The room felt close and confined in which she
awaited her interview with Mr. Johnson, who had sent down an apology
for having overslept himself, and at last made his appearance in a hurried
half-awakened state, in consequence of his late hospitality of the night
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry I gave you all so much trouble last night,&rdquo;
said Ellinor, apologetically.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was overtired, and much
shocked by the news I heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No trouble, no trouble, I am sure.&nbsp; Neither Mrs. Johnson
nor I felt it in the least a trouble.&nbsp; Many ladies I know feel
such things very trying, though there are others that can stand a judge&rsquo;s
putting on the black cap better than most men.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
I saw some as composed as could be under Judge Corbet&rsquo;s speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But about Dixon?&nbsp; He must not die, Mr. Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know that he will,&rdquo; said Mr. Johnson,
in something of the tone of voice he would have used in soothing a child.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Judge Corbet said something about the possibility of a pardon.&nbsp;
The jury did not recommend him to mercy: you see, his looks went so
much against him, and all the evidence was so strong, and no defence,
so to speak, for he would not furnish any information on which we could
base defence.&nbsp; But the judge did give some hope, to my mind, though
there are others that think differently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Mr. Johnson, he must not die, and he shall not.&nbsp;
To whom must I go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&nbsp; Have you got additional evidence?&rdquo; with
a sudden sharp glance of professional inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; Ellinor answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I beg your
pardon . . . only tell me into whose hands the power of life and death
has passed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into the Home Secretary&rsquo;s&mdash;Sir Phillip Homes; but
you cannot get access to him on such an errand.&nbsp; It is the judge
who tried the case that must urge a reprieve&mdash;Judge Corbet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judge Corbet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and he was rather inclined to take a merciful view of
the whole case.&nbsp; I saw it in his charge.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be the
person for you to see.&nbsp; I suppose you don&rsquo;t like to give
me your confidence, or else I could arrange and draw up what will have
to be said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; What I have to say must be spoken to the arbiter&mdash;to
no one else.&nbsp; I am afraid I answered you impatiently just now.&nbsp;
You must forgive me; if you knew all, I am sure you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say no more, my dear lady.&nbsp; We will suppose you have
some evidence not adduced at the trial.&nbsp; Well; you must go up and
see the judge, since you don&rsquo;t choose to impart it to any one,
and lay it before him.&nbsp; He will doubtless compare it with his notes
of the trial, and see how far it agrees with them.&nbsp; Of course you
must be prepared with some kind of proof; for Judge Corbet will have
to test your evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems strange to think of him as the judge,&rdquo; said
Ellinor, almost to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s but a young judge.&nbsp; You knew
him at Hamley, I suppose?&nbsp; I remember his reading there with Mr.
Ness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but do not let us talk more about that time.&nbsp; Tell
me when can I see Dixon?&nbsp; I have been to the castle already, but
they said I must have a sheriff&rsquo;s order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure.&nbsp; I desired Mrs. Johnson to tell you so last
night.&nbsp; Old Ormerod was dining here; he is clerk to the magistrates,
and I told him of your wish.&nbsp; He said he would see Sir Henry Croper,
and have the order here before ten.&nbsp; But all this time Mrs. Johnson
is waiting breakfast for us.&nbsp; Let me take you into the dining-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was very hard work for Ellinor to do her duty as a guest, and
to allow herself to be interested and talked to on local affairs by
her host and hostess.&nbsp; But she felt as if she had spoken shortly
and abruptly to Mr. Johnson in their previous conversation, and that
she must try and make amends for it; so she attended to all the details
about the restoration of the church, and the difficulty of getting a
good music-master for the three little Miss Johnsons, with all her usual
gentle good breeding and patience, though no one can tell how her heart
and imagination were full of the coming interview with poor old Dixon.</p>
<p>By-and-by Mr. Johnson was called out of the room to see Mr. Ormerod,
and receive the order of admission from him.&nbsp; Ellinor clasped her
hands tight together as she listened with apparent composure to Mrs
Johnson&rsquo;s never-ending praise of the Hullah system.&nbsp; But
when Mr. Johnson returned, she could not help interrupting her eulogy,
and saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I may go now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, the order was there&mdash;she might go, and Mr. Johnson would
accompany her, to see that she met with no difficulty or obstacle.</p>
<p>As they walked thither, he told her that some one&mdash;a turnkey,
or some one&mdash;would have to be present at the interview; that such
was always the rule in the case of condemned prisoners; but that if
this third person was &ldquo;obliging,&rdquo; he would keep out of earshot.&nbsp;
Mr. Johnson quietly took care to see that the turnkey who accompanied
Ellinor was &ldquo;obliging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man took her across high-walled courts, along stone corridors,
and through many locked doors, before they came to the condemned cells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had three at a time in here,&rdquo; said he, unlocking
the final door, &ldquo;after Judge Morton had been here.&nbsp; We always
called him the &lsquo;Hanging Judge.&rsquo;&nbsp; But its five years
since he died, and now there&rsquo;s never more than one in at a time;
though once it was a woman for poisoning her husband.&nbsp; Mary Jones
was her name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stone passage out of which the cells opened was light, and bare,
and scrupulously clean.&nbsp; Over each door was a small barred window,
and an outer window of the same description was placed high up in the
cell, which the turnkey now opened.</p>
<p>Old Abraham Dixon was sitting on the side of his bed, doing nothing.&nbsp;
His head was bent, his frame sunk, and he did not seem to care to turn
round and see who it was that entered.</p>
<p>Ellinor tried to keep down her sobs while the man went up to him,
and laying his hand on his shoulder, and lightly shaking him, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a friend come to see you, Dixon.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then, turning to Ellinor, he added, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some as takes
it in this kind o&rsquo; stunned way, while others are as restless as
a wild beast in a cage, after they&rsquo;re sentenced.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then he withdrew into the passage, leaving the door open, so that
he could see all that passed if he chose to look, but ostentatiously
keeping his eyes averted, and whistling to himself, so that he could
not hear what they said to each other.</p>
<p>Dixon looked up at Ellinor, but then let his eyes fall on the ground
again; the increasing trembling of his shrunken frame was the only sign
he gave that he had recognised her.</p>
<p>She sat down by him, and took his large horny hand in hers.&nbsp;
She wanted to overcome her inclination to sob hysterically before she
spoke.&nbsp; She stroked the bony shrivelled fingers, on which her hot
scalding tears kept dropping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunnot do that,&rdquo; said he, at length, in a hollow voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dunnot take on about it; it&rsquo;s best as it is, missy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dixon, it&rsquo;s not best.&nbsp; It shall not be.&nbsp;
You know it shall not&mdash;cannot be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather tired of living.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been a
great strain and labour for me.&nbsp; I think I&rsquo;d as lief be with
God as with men.&nbsp; And you see, I were fond on him ever sin&rsquo;
he were a little lad, and told me what hard times he had at school,
he did, just as if I were his brother!&nbsp; I loved him next to Molly
Greaves.&nbsp; Dear! and I shall see her again, I reckon, come next
Saturday week!&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll think well on me, up there, I&rsquo;ll
be bound; though I cannot say as I&rsquo;ve done all as I should do
here below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Dixon,&rdquo; said Ellinor, &ldquo;you know who did this&mdash;this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guilty o&rsquo; murder,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what they called it.&nbsp; Murder!&nbsp; And that it never were, choose
who did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor, poor father did it.&nbsp; I am going up to London
this afternoon; I am going to see the judge, and tell him all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you demean yourself to that fellow, missy.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s him as left you in the lurch as soon as sorrow and shame
came nigh you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up at her now, for the first time; but she went on as if
she had not noticed those wistful, weary eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&nbsp; I shall go to him.&nbsp; I know who it is; and
I am resolved.&nbsp; After all, he may be better than a stranger, for
real help; and I shall never remember any&mdash;anything else, when
I think of you, good faithful friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks but a wizened old fellow in his grey wig.&nbsp; I
should hardly ha&rsquo; known him.&nbsp; I gave him a look, as much
as to say, &lsquo;I could tell tales o&rsquo; you, my lord judge, if
I chose.&rsquo;&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know if he heeded me, though.&nbsp;
I suppose it were for a sign of old acquaintance that he said he&rsquo;d
recommend me to mercy.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;d sooner have death nor mercy,
by long odds.&nbsp; Yon man out there says mercy means Botany Bay.&nbsp;
It &rsquo;ud be like killing me by inches, that would.&nbsp; It would.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d liefer go straight to Heaven, than live on among the black
folk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to shake again: this idea of transportation, from its very
mysteriousness, was more terrifying to him than death.&nbsp; He kept
on saying plaintively, &ldquo;Missy, you&rsquo;ll never let &rsquo;em
send me to Botany Bay; I couldn&rsquo;t stand that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall come out of
this prison, and go home with me to East Chester; I promise you you
shall.&nbsp; I promise you.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t yet quite know how,
but trust in my promise.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t fret about Botany Bay.&nbsp;
If you go there, I go too.&nbsp; I am so sure you will not go.&nbsp;
And you know if you have done anything against the law in concealing
that fatal night&rsquo;s work, I did too, and if you are to be punished,
I will be punished too.&nbsp; But I feel sure it will be right; I mean,
as right as anything can be, with the recollection of that time present
to us, as it must always be.&rdquo;&nbsp; She almost spoke these last
words to herself.&nbsp; They sat on, hand in hand for a few minutes
more in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d come to me.&nbsp; I knowed you were
far away in foreign parts.&nbsp; But I used to pray to God.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear
Lord God!&rsquo; I used to say, &lsquo;let me see her again.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I told the chaplain as I&rsquo;d begin to pray for repentance, at after
I&rsquo;d done praying that I might see you once again: for it just
seemed to take all my strength to say those words as I&rsquo;ve named.&nbsp;
And I thought as how God knew what was in my heart better than I could
tell Him: how I was main and sorry for all as I&rsquo;d ever done wrong;
I allays were, at after it was done; but I thought as no one could know
how bitter-keen I wanted to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again they sank into silence.&nbsp; Ellinor felt as if she would
fain be away and active in procuring his release; but she also perceived
how precious her presence was to him; and she did not like to leave
him a moment before the time allowed her.&nbsp; His voice had changed
to a weak, piping old man&rsquo;s quaver, and between the times of his
talking he seemed to relapse into a dreamy state; but through it all
he held her hand tight, as though afraid that she would leave him.</p>
<p>So the hour elapsed, with no more spoken words than those above.&nbsp;
From time to time Ellinor&rsquo;s tears dropped down upon her lap; she
could not restrain them, though she scarce knew why she cried just then.</p>
<p>At length the turnkey said that the time allowed for the interview
was ended.&nbsp; Ellinor spoke no word; but rose, and bent down and
kissed the old man&rsquo;s forehead, saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall come back to-morrow.&nbsp; God keep and comfort you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So almost without an articulate word from him in reply (he rose up,
and stood on his shaking legs, as she bade him farewell, putting his
hand to his head with the old habitual mark of respect), she went her
way, swiftly out of the prison, swiftly back with Mr. Johnson to his
house, scarcely patient or strong enough in her hurry to explain to
him fully all that she meant to do.&nbsp; She only asked him a few absolutely
requisite questions; and informed him of her intention to go straight
to London to see Judge Corbet.</p>
<p>Just before the railway carriage in which she was seated started
on the journey, she bent forward, and put out her hand once more to
Mr. Johnson.&nbsp; &ldquo;To-morrow I will thank you for all,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was about the same time that she had reached Hellingford on the
previous night, that she arrived at the Great Western station on this
evening&mdash;past eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; On the way she had remembered
and arranged many things: one important question she had omitted to
ask Mr. Johnson; but that was easily remedied.&nbsp; She had not enquired
where she could find Judge Corbet; if she had, Mr. Johnson could probably
have given her his professional address.&nbsp; As it was, she asked
for a Post-Office Directory at the hotel, and looked out for his private
dwelling&mdash;128 Hyde Park Gardens.</p>
<p>She rang for a waiter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I send a messenger to Hyde Park Gardens?&rdquo; she said,
hurrying on to her business, tired and worn out as she was.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is only to ask if Judge Corbet is at home this evening.&nbsp; If he
is, I must go and see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waiter was a little surprised, and would gladly have had her
name to authorise the enquiry but she could not bear to send it: it
would be bad enough that first meeting, without the feeling that he,
too, had had time to recall all the past days.&nbsp; Better to go in
upon him unprepared, and plunge into the subject.</p>
<p>The waiter returned with the answer while she yet was pacing up and
down the room restlessly, nerving herself for the interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The messenger has been to Hyde Park Gardens, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp;
The Judge and Lady Corbet are gone out to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Corbet!&nbsp; Of course Ellinor knew that he was married.&nbsp;
Had she not been present at the wedding in East Chester Cathedral?&nbsp;
But, somehow, these recent events had so carried her back to old times,
that the intimate association of the names, &ldquo;the Judge and Lady
Corbet,&rdquo; seemed to awaken her out of some dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; she said, just as if these thoughts
were not passing rapidly through her mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me be called
at seven to-morrow morning, and let me have a cab at the door to Hyde
Park Gardens at eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so she went to bed; but scarcely to sleep.&nbsp; All night long
she had the scenes of those old times, the happy, happy days of her
youth, the one terrible night that cut all happiness short, present
before her.&nbsp; She could almost have fancied that she heard the long-silent
sounds of her father&rsquo;s step, her father&rsquo;s way of breathing,
the rustle of his newspaper as he hastily turned it over, coming through
the lapse of years; the silence of the night.&nbsp; She knew that she
had the little writing-case of her girlhood with her, in her box.&nbsp;
The treasures of the dead that it contained, the morsel of dainty sewing,
the little sister&rsquo;s golden curl, the half-finished letter to Mr.
Corbet, were all there.&nbsp; She took them out, and looked at each
separately; looked at them long&mdash;long and wistfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will
it be of any use to me?&rdquo; she questioned of herself, as she was
about to put her father&rsquo;s letter back into its receptacle.&nbsp;
She read the last words over again, once more:</p>
<p>&ldquo;From my death-bed I adjure you to stand her friend; I will
beg pardon on my knees for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take it,&rdquo; thought she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I need not
bring it out; most likely there will be no need for it, after what I
shall have to say.&nbsp; All is so altered, so changed between us, as
utterly as if it never had been, that I think I shall have no shame
in showing it him, for my own part of it.&nbsp; While, if he sees poor
papa&rsquo;s, dear, dear papa&rsquo;s suffering humility, it may make
him think more gently of one who loved him once though they parted in
wrath with each other, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she took the letter with her when she drove to Hyde Park Gardens.</p>
<p>Every nerve in her body was in such a high state of tension that
she could have screamed out at the cabman&rsquo;s boisterous knock at
the door.&nbsp; She got out hastily, before any one was ready or willing
to answer such an untimely summons; paid the man double what he ought
to have had; and stood there, sick, trembling, and humble.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI AND LAST.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Is Judge Corbet at home?&nbsp; Can I see him?&rdquo; she asked
of the footman, who at length answered the door.</p>
<p>He looked at her curiously, and a little familiarly, before he replied,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s pretty sure to be at home at this
time of day; but whether he&rsquo;ll see you is quite another thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you be so good as to ask him?&nbsp; It is on very particular
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you give me a card? your name, perhaps, will do, if you
have not a card.&nbsp; I say, Simmons&rdquo; (to a lady&rsquo;s-maid
crossing the hall), &ldquo;is the judge up yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! he&rsquo;s in his dressing-room this half-hour.&nbsp;
My lady is coming down directly.&nbsp; It is just breakfast-time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you put it off and come again, a little later?&rdquo;
said he, turning once more to Ellinor&mdash;white Ellinor! trembling
Ellinor!</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! please let me come in.&nbsp; I will wait.&nbsp; I am sure
Judge Corbet will see me, if you will tell him I am here.&nbsp; Miss
Wilkins.&nbsp; He will know the name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then; will you wait here till I have got breakfast in?&rdquo;
said the man, letting her into the hall, and pointing to the bench there,
he took her, from her dress, to be a lady&rsquo;s-maid or governess,
or at most a tradesman&rsquo;s daughter; and, besides, he was behindhand
with all his preparations.&nbsp; She came in and sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will tell him I am here,&rdquo; she said faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, never fear: I&rsquo;ll send up word, though I don&rsquo;t
believe he&rsquo;ll come to you before breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told a page, who ran upstairs, and, knocking at the judge&rsquo;s
door, said that a Miss Jenkins wanted to speak to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked the judge from the inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Jenkins.&nbsp; She said you would know the name, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I.&nbsp; Tell her to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Ellinor waited.&nbsp; Presently down the stairs, with slow deliberate
dignity, came the handsome Lady Corbet, in her rustling silks and ample
petticoats, carrying her fine boy, and followed by her majestic nurse.&nbsp;
She was ill-pleased that any one should come and take up her husband&rsquo;s
time when he was at home, and supposed to be enjoying domestic leisure;
and her imperious, inconsiderate nature did not prompt her to any civility
towards the gentle creature sitting down, weary and heart-sick, in her
house.&nbsp; On the contrary, she looked her over as she slowly descended,
till Ellinor shrank abashed from the steady gaze of the large black
eyes.&nbsp; Then she, her baby and nurse, disappeared into the large
dining-room, into which all the preparations for breakfast had been
carried.</p>
<p>The next person to come down would be the judge.&nbsp; Ellinor instinctively
put down her veil.&nbsp; She heard his quick decided step; she had known
it well of old.</p>
<p>He gave one of his sharp, shrewd glances at the person sitting in
the hall and waiting to speak to him, and his practised eye recognised
the lady at once, in spite of her travel-worn dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you just come into this room?&rdquo; said he, opening
the door of his study, to the front of the house: the dining-room was
to the back; they communicated by folding-doors.</p>
<p>The astute lawyer placed himself with his back to the window; it
was the natural position of the master of the apartment; but it also
gave him the advantage of seeing his companion&rsquo;s face in full
light.&nbsp; Ellinor lifted her veil; it had only been a dislike to
a recognition in the hall which had made her put it down.</p>
<p>Judge Corbet&rsquo;s countenance changed more than hers; she had
been prepared for the interview; he was not.&nbsp; But he usually had
the full command of the expression on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellinor!&nbsp; Miss Wilkins! is it you?&rdquo;&nbsp; And he
went forwards, holding out his hand with cordial greeting, under which
the embarrassment, if he felt any, was carefully concealed.&nbsp; She
could not speak all at once in the way she wished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That stupid Henry told me &lsquo;Jenkins!&rsquo;&nbsp; I beg
your pardon.&nbsp; How could they put you down to sit in the hall?&nbsp;
You must come in and have some breakfast with us; Lady Corbet will be
delighted, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;&nbsp; His sense of the awkwardness
of the meeting with the woman who was once to have been his wife, and
of the probable introduction which was to follow to the woman who was
his actual wife grew upon him, and made him speak a little hurriedly.&nbsp;
Ellinor&rsquo;s next words were a wonderful relief; and her soft gentle
way of speaking was like the touch of a cooling balsam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, you must excuse me.&nbsp; I am come strictly on
business, otherwise I should never have thought of calling on you at
such an hour.&nbsp; It is about poor Dixon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; I thought as much!&rdquo; said the judge, handing
her a chair, and sitting down himself.&nbsp; He tried to compose his
mind to business, but in spite of his strength of character, and his
present efforts, the remembrance of old times would come back at the
sound of her voice.&nbsp; He wondered if he was as much changed in appearance
as she struck him as being in that first look of recognition; after
that first glance he rather avoided meeting her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew how much you would feel it.&nbsp; Some one at Hellingford
told me you were abroad, in Rome, I think.&nbsp; But you must not distress
yourself unnecessarily; the sentence is sure to be commuted to transportation,
or something equivalent.&nbsp; I was talking to the Home Secretary about
it only last night.&nbsp; Lapse of time and subsequent good character
quite preclude any idea of capital punishment.&rdquo;&nbsp; All the
time that he said this he had other thoughts at the back of his mind&mdash;some
curiosity, a little regret, a touch of remorse, a wonder how the meeting
(which, of course, would have to be some time) between Lady Corbet and
Ellinor would go off; but he spoke clearly enough on the subject in
hand, and no outward mark of distraction from it appeared.</p>
<p>Ellinor answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to tell you, what I suppose may be told to any judge,
in confidence and full reliance on his secrecy, that Abraham Dixon was
not the murderer.&rdquo;&nbsp; She stopped short, and choked a little.</p>
<p>The judge looked sharply at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you know who was?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, with a low, steady voice, looking
him full in the face, with sad, solemn eyes.</p>
<p>The truth flashed into his mind.&nbsp; He shaded his face, and did
not speak for a minute or two.&nbsp; Then he said, not looking up, a
little hoarsely, &ldquo;This, then, was the shame you told me of long
ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>Both sat quite still; quite silent for some time.&nbsp; Through the
silence a sharp, clear voice was heard speaking through the folding-doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the kedgeree down, and tell the cook to keep it hot for
the judge.&nbsp; It is so tiresome people coming on business here, as
if the judge had not his proper hours for being at chambers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got up hastily, and went into the dining-room; but he had audibly
some difficulty in curbing his wife&rsquo;s irritation.</p>
<p>When he came back, Ellinor said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I ought not to have come here now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s all nonsense!&rdquo; said he, in a tone of
annoyance.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done quite right.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He seated himself where he had been before; and again half covered his
face with his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Dixon knew of this.&nbsp; I believe I must put the fact
plainly&mdash;to you&mdash;your father was the guilty person? he murdered
Dunster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; If you call it murder.&nbsp; It was done by a blow,
in the heat of passion.&nbsp; No one can ever tell how Dunster always
irritated papa,&rdquo; said Ellinor, in a stupid, heavy way; and then
she sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know this?&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a kind of tender
reluctance in the judge&rsquo;s voice, as he put all these questions.&nbsp;
Ellinor had made up her mind beforehand that something like them must
be asked, and must also be answered; but she spoke like a sleep-walker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came into papa&rsquo;s room just after he had struck Mr.
Dunster the blow.&nbsp; He was lying insensible, as we thought&mdash;dead,
as he really was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was Dixon&rsquo;s part in it?&nbsp; He must have known
a good deal about it.&nbsp; And the horse-lancet that was found with
his name upon it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa went to wake Dixon, and he brought his fleam&mdash;I
suppose to try and bleed him.&nbsp; I have said enough, have I not?&nbsp;
I seem so confused.&nbsp; But I will answer any question to make it
appear that Dixon is innocent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judge had been noting all down.&nbsp; He sat still now without
replying to her.&nbsp; Then he wrote rapidly, referring to his previous
paper, from time to time.&nbsp; In five minutes or so he read the facts
which Ellinor had stated, as he now arranged them, in a legal and connected
form.&nbsp; He just asked her one or two trivial questions as he did
so.&nbsp; Then he read it over to her, and asked her to sign it.&nbsp;
She took up the pen, and held it, hesitating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will never be made public?&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I shall take care that no one but the Home Secretary sees
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&nbsp; I could not help it, now it has come to this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are not many men like Dixon,&rdquo; said the judge,
almost to himself, as he sealed the paper in an envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ellinor; &ldquo;I never knew any one so faithful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And just at the same moment the reflection on a less faithful person
that these words might seem to imply struck both of them, and each instinctively
glanced at the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ellinor!&rdquo; said the judge, after a moment&rsquo;s pause,
&ldquo;we are friends, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; friends,&rdquo; said she, quietly and sadly.</p>
<p>He felt a little chagrined at her answer.&nbsp; Why, he could hardly
tell.&nbsp; To cover any sign of his feeling he went on talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you living now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At East Chester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you come sometimes to town, don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Let
us know always&mdash;whenever you come; and Lady Corbet shall call on
you.&nbsp; Indeed, I wish you&rsquo;d let me bring her to see you to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&nbsp; I am going straight back to Hellingford;
at least, as soon as you can get me the pardon for Dixon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He half smiled at her ignorance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pardon must be sent to the sheriff, who holds the warrant
for his execution.&nbsp; But, of course, you may have every assurance
that it shall be sent as soon as possible.&nbsp; It is just the same
as if he had it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; said Ellinor rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t go without breakfast.&nbsp; If you would
rather not see Lady Corbet just now, it shall be sent in to you in this
room, unless you have already breakfasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you; I would rather not.&nbsp; You are very kind,
and I am very glad to have seen you once again.&nbsp; There is just
one thing more,&rdquo; said she, colouring a little and hesitating.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This note to you was found under papa&rsquo;s pillow after his
death; some of it refers to past things; but I should be glad if you
could think as kindly as you can of poor papa&mdash;and so&mdash;if
you will read it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took it and read it, not without emotion.&nbsp; Then he laid it
down on his table, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor man! he must have suffered a great deal for that night&rsquo;s
work.&nbsp; And you, Ellinor, you have suffered, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, she had suffered; and he who spoke had been one of the instruments
of her suffering, although he seemed forgetful of it.&nbsp; She shook
her head a little for reply.&nbsp; Then she looked up at him&mdash;they
were both standing at the time&mdash;and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I shall be happier now.&nbsp; I always knew it must
be found out.&nbsp; Once more, good-by, and thank you.&nbsp; I may take
this letter, I suppose?&rdquo; said she, casting envious loving eyes
at her father&rsquo;s note, lying unregarded on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! certainly, certainly,&rdquo; said he; and then he took
her hand; he held it, while he looked into her face.&nbsp; He had thought
it changed when he had first seen her, but it was now almost the same
to him as of yore.&nbsp; The sweet shy eyes, the indicated dimple in
the cheek, and something of fever had brought a faint pink flush into
her usually colourless cheeks.&nbsp; Married judge though he was, he
was not sure if she had not more charms for him still in her sorrow
and her shabbiness than the handsome stately wife in the next room,
whose looks had not been of the pleasantest when he left her a few minutes
before.&nbsp; He sighed a little regretfully as Ellinor went away.&nbsp;
He had obtained the position he had struggled for, and sacrificed for;
but now he could not help wishing that the slaughtered creature laid
on the shrine of his ambition were alive again.</p>
<p>The kedgeree was brought up again, smoking hot, but it remained untasted
by him; and though he appeared to be reading the <i>Times</i>, he did
not see a word of the distinct type.&nbsp; His wife, meanwhile, continued
her complaints of the untimely visitor, whose name he did not give to
her in its corrected form, as he was not anxious that she should have
it in her power to identify the call of this morning with a possible
future acquaintance.</p>
<p>When Ellinor reached Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s house in Hellingford that
afternoon, she found Miss Monro was there, and that she had been with
much difficulty restrained by Mr. Johnson from following her to London.</p>
<p>Miss Monro fondled and purred inarticulately through her tears over
her recovered darling, before she could speak intelligibly enough to
tell her that Canon Livingstone had come straight to see her immediately
on his return to East Chester, and had suggested her journey to Hellingford,
in order that she might be of all the comfort she could to Ellinor.&nbsp;
She did not at first let out that he had accompanied her to Hellingford;
she was a little afraid of Ellinor&rsquo;s displeasure at his being
there; Ellinor had always objected so much to any advance towards intimacy
with him that Miss Monro had wished to make.&nbsp; But Ellinor was different
now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How white you are, Nelly!&rdquo; said Miss Monro.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
have been travelling too much and too fast, my child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My head aches!&rdquo; said Ellinor, wearily.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
I must go to the castle, and tell my poor Dixon that he is reprieved&mdash;I
am so tired!&nbsp; Will you ask Mr. Johnson to get me leave to see him?&nbsp;
He will know all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw herself down on the bed in the spare room; the bed with
the heavy blue curtains.&nbsp; After an unheeded remonstrance, Miss
Monro went to do her bidding.&nbsp; But it was now late afternoon, and
Mr. Johnson said that it would be impossible for him to get permission
from the sheriff that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said he, courteously, &ldquo;one scarcely
knows whether Miss Wilkins may not give the old man false hopes&mdash;whether
she has not been excited to have false hopes herself; it might be a
cruel kindness to let her see him, without more legal certainty as to
what his sentence, or reprieve, is to be.&nbsp; By to-morrow morning,
if I have properly understood her story, which was a little confused&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is so dreadfully tired, poor creature,&rdquo; put in Miss
Monro, who never could bear the shadow of a suspicion that Ellinor was
not wisest, best, in all relations and situations of life.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson went on, with a deprecatory bow: &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;it
really is the only course open to her besides&mdash;persuade her to
rest for this evening.&nbsp; By to-morrow morning I will have obtained
the sheriff&rsquo;s leave, and he will most likely have heard from London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you!&nbsp; I believe that will be best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the only course,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>When Miss Monro returned to the bedroom, Ellinor was in a heavy feverish
slumber; so feverish and so uneasy did she appear, that, after the hesitation
of a moment or two, Miss Monro had no scruple in wakening her.</p>
<p>But she did not appear to understand the answer to her request; she
did not seem even to remember that she had made any request.</p>
<p>The journey to England, the misery, the surprises, had been too much
for her.&nbsp; The morrow morning came, bringing the formal free pardon
for Abraham Dixon.&nbsp; The sheriff&rsquo;s order for her admission
to see the old man lay awaiting her wish to use it; but she knew nothing
of all this.</p>
<p>For days, nay weeks, she hovered between life and death, tended,
as of old, by Miss Monro, while good Mrs. Johnson was ever willing to
assist.</p>
<p>One summer evening in early June she wakened into memory, Miss Monro
heard the faint piping voice, as she kept her watch by the bedside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Dixon?&rdquo; asked she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the canon&rsquo;s house at Bromham.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
the name of Dr. Livingstone&rsquo;s county parish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought it better to get him into country air and fresh
scenes at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much better.&nbsp; Get strong, and he shall come to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure all is right?&rdquo; said Ellinor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, my dear.&nbsp; All is quite right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Ellinor went to sleep again out of very weakness and weariness.</p>
<p>From that time she recovered pretty steadily.&nbsp; Her great desire
was to return to East Chester as soon as possible.&nbsp; The associations
of grief, anxiety, and coming illness, connected with Hellingford, made
her wish to be once again in the solemn, quiet, sunny close of East
Chester.</p>
<p>Canon Livingstone came over to assist Miss Monro in managing the
journey with her invalid.&nbsp; But he did not intrude himself upon
Ellinor, any more than he had done in coming from home.</p>
<p>The morning after her return, Miss Monro said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you feel strong enough to see Dixon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is at the canon&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; He sent for him from
Bromham, in order that he might be ready for you to see him when you
wished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please let him come directly,&rdquo; said Ellinor, flushing
and trembling.</p>
<p>She went to the door to meet the tottering old man; she led him to
the easy-chair that had been placed and arranged for herself; she knelt
down before him, and put his hands on her head, he trembling and shaking
all the while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me all the shame and misery, Dixon.&nbsp; Say you
forgive me; and give me your blessing.&nbsp; And then let never a word
of the terrible past be spoken between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for me to forgive you, as never did harm to
no one&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say you do&mdash;it will ease my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgive thee!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; And then he raised himself
to his feet with effort, and, standing up above her, he blessed her
solemnly.</p>
<p>After that he sat down, she by him, gazing at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yon&rsquo;s a good man, missy,&rdquo; he said, at length,
lifting his slow eyes and looking at her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Better nor t&rsquo;other
ever was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a good man,&rdquo; said Ellinor.</p>
<p>But no more was spoken on the subject.&nbsp; The next day, Canon
Livingstone made his formal call.&nbsp; Ellinor would fain have kept
Miss Monro in the room, but that worthy lady knew better than to stop.</p>
<p>They went on, forcing talk on indifferent subjects.&nbsp; At last
he could speak no longer on everything but that which he had most at
heart.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss Wilkins!&rdquo; (he had got up, and was standing
by the mantelpiece, apparently examining the ornaments upon it)&mdash;&ldquo;Miss
Wilkins! is there any chance of your giving me a favourable answer now&mdash;you
know what I mean&mdash;what we spoke about at the Great Western Hotel,
that day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellinor hung her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that I was once engaged before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&nbsp; I know; to Mr. Corbet&mdash;he that is now the
judge; you cannot suppose that would make any difference, if that is
all.&nbsp; I have loved you, and you only, ever since we met, eighteen
years ago.&nbsp; Miss Wilkins&mdash;Ellinor&mdash;put me out of suspense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo; said she, putting out her thin white hand for
him to take and kiss, almost with tears of gratitude, but she seemed
frightened at his impetuosity, and tried to check him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wait&mdash;you
have not heard all&mdash;my poor, poor father, in a fit of anger, irritated
beyond his bearing, struck the blow that killed Mr. Dunster&mdash;Dixon
and I knew of it, just after the blow was struck&mdash;we helped to
hide it&mdash;we kept the secret&mdash;my poor father died of sorrow
and remorse&mdash;you now know all&mdash;can you still love me?&nbsp;
It seems to me as if I had been an accomplice in such a terrible thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor, poor Ellinor!&rdquo; said he, now taking her in his
arms as a shelter.&nbsp; &ldquo;How I wish I had known of all this years
and years ago: I could have stood between you and so much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who pass through the village of Bromham, and pause to look
over the laurel-hedge that separates the rectory garden from the road,
may often see, on summer days, an old, old man, sitting in a wicker-chair,
out upon the lawn.&nbsp; He leans upon his stick, and seldom raises
his bent head; but for all that his eyes are on a level with the two
little fairy children who come to him in all their small joys and sorrows,
and who learnt to lisp his name almost as soon as they did that of their
father and mother.</p>
<p>Nor is Miss Monro often absent; and although she prefers to retain
the old house in the Close for winter quarters, she generally makes
her way across to Canon Livingstone&rsquo;s residence every evening.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
